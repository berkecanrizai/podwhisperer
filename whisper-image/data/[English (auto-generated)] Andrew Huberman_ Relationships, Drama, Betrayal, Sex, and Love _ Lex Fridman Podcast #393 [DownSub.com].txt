listen when it comes to romantic

relationships if it's not a hundred

percent in you

it ain't happening and I've never seen

a violation of that statement

where it's like it yeah it's mostly good

and they're this is like the

negotiations well already you're you're

it's doomed and that doesn't mean

someone has to be perfect the

relationship has to be perfect but it's

got to feel 100 inside like yes yes and

yes

the following is a conversation with my

dear friend Andrew huberman his fourth

time on this podcast it's my birthday so

this is a special birthday episode of

sorts Andrew flew down to Austin just to

wish me happy birthday and we decided to

do a podcast last second we literally

talked for hours beforehand in a long

time after late into the night he's one

of my favorite human beings brilliant

scientists incredible teacher and a

loyal friend I'm grateful for Andrew I'm

grateful for good friends for all the

support and love I've gotten over the

past few years

I'm truly grateful for this life for the

years the days the minutes the seconds

I've gotten to live on this beautiful

Earth of ours I really don't want to

leave just yet

I think I'd really like to stick around

I love you all

this is the last treatment podcast and

now dear friends here's Andrew

huberman

trying to uh

run a little bit more are you losing

weight I'm not trying to lose weight but

I always do the same Fitness routine

after like 30 years basically uh lift

three days a week run three days a week

um but one of the runs is the long run

one of them's medium one of them's a

Sprint type thing so

um what I've decided to do this year was

just extend the duration of the long run

and

um I like being a mobile I I never want

to be

um so heavy that I can't move like like

I want to be able to go out and run 10

miles if I have to so sometimes I do

um and I want to be able to Sprint if I

have to so sometimes I do and um lifting

in objects is feels good it feels good

to train like a lazy bear and just lift

heavy objects but I've also started

training with lighter weights and higher

repetitions and

um for three month cycles and it gives

your joints a rest and um yeah so

probably you know it I think it also is

interesting to see how training

differently changes your cognition

that's probably hormone related you know

hormones Downstream of training heavy

versus hormones Downstream of training a

little bit lighter

um I think my cognition is better when

I'm doing more cardio and when the

repetition ranges are a little bit

higher which is not to say that people

who lift heavy are dumb but there is a

because there's real value in lifting

heavy there's a lot of angry people

listening to this right now no no no but

lifting heavy and then taking three to

five minutes rest is Far and Away a

different

challenge than running hard for 90

minutes

that's a tough thing just like getting

in an ice bath people say oh well how is

that any different than working out

um well there are a lot of differences

but one of them is that it's very acute

stress within one second you're stressed

so I I think subjecting the body to a

bunch of different types of stressors in

space and time is really valuable so

yeah I've been playing with the

variables in a pretty systematic way

well I like long and slow

for like you said the impact it has on

my cognition yeah it it uh the

wordlessness of it

um the way it puts you in in a the way

it seems to

um clean out the Clutter yeah you know

um it can take away that hyper focus and

put you more in a relaxed

Focus for sure well for me it brings the

Clutter to the surface at first like all

these thoughts come in there and then

they dissipate you know I've been uh

because I got knee barred pretty hard

that's when somebody tries to break here

they try and break your knee yeah

because you tap so they yeah yeah yeah

so it's you know hyper extend they need

that direction the guy knee barred

pretty hard so um in ways I don't

understand it kind of hurts to run I

don't understand what's happening behind

there I need to investigate this

it basically this the hamstring Flex

like curling your leg hurts a little bit

okay and that results in this weird doll

but sometimes extremely sharp pain in

the back of the knee so I'm I'm working

I'm I'm working through this anyway but

walking doesn't hurt so I've been

playing around with walking recently

like for two hours and thinking because

I know a lot of like

smart people throughout history have

walked and thought you have to like you

know play with things that have worked

for others not just to exercise but to

like integrate this very light kind of

prolonged exercise into a productive

life so they do all their thinking while

they walk it's like a meditative type of

walking it's it's really interesting it

really works yeah the um the practice

I've been doing a lot more of lately as

I walk while reading a book in the yard

I'll just Pace back and forth or walk in

a circle audiobook are you talking no

hard copy where you just holding I

holding the book and I'm walking and I'm

reading yeah and I usually have a pen

and I'm underlining I have this whole

system like underlining Stars

exclamation points goes back to

University of what things I'll go back

to

um which things I export to notes and

that kind of thing

um but from the beginning when I opened

my lab at that time in San Diego before

I moved back to Stanford

um I would have meetings with my

students or postdocs by just walking in

the field behind the lab

um you know and I'd bring my Bulldog

Costello yeah Bulldog Mastiff at the

time and he was a slow Walker so these

were slow walks but I can think much

more clearly that way there's a Nobel

prize-winning uh professor at Columbia

University School of Medicine Richard

Axel who won the Nobel Prize co1 Nobel

Prize with Linda Buck for the discovery

of the molecular basis of olfaction and

um he walks in voice dictates his papers

and now with rev or these other maybe

there are better ones um than rev where

you can convert audio files into text

very quickly and then edit from there so

I I will often voice dictate

um first drafts and things like that and

um I totally agree on the long runs the

walks the integrating that with

cognitive work harder to do with Sprints

um and then the gym you know are you do

you weight train you just seem naturally

strong and like thicker jointed it's

true yeah it's true I when we did the

one very beginner because I'm a very

beginner of Jiu Jitsu class together

and um yeah as I mentioned then uh but

if people missed it uh Alexis freakishly

strong I think I was born genetically to

hug people oh like Costello yeah exactly

you guys have a certain similarity he

had wrists like you know it's like you

and Jocko and Costello have these like

wrists and and elbows that are super

thick you know and then when you look

around you see tremendous variation you

know some people have like the the

um wrist uh width of a whippet or Woody

Allen and then other people like you or

Jocko or you know there's this one uh

Jocko video or thing on GQ or something

Have you seen the comments on Jocko

these are the best

um the comments I love the comments on

YouTube because occasionally they're

funny

um the best is uh when shock was born

the doctor looked at his uh parents and

said it's a man

it's like Chuck Norris type comments

yeah yeah those are great um that's what

I miss about Rogan being on YouTube with

the full-length episodes oh that

comments so this is technically a

birthday podcast uh what do you love

most about getting older

it's like a it the confirmation

that comes from

getting more and more data which

basically says yeah the first time you

thought that thing it was actually right

because the second third and fourth and

fifth time

um it turned out the exact same way in

other words

um there have been a few times in my

life where

I did not feel

easy about something I did I felt

a signal for my body this is not good

um and I didn't trust it early on but I

knew it was there

and then

two or three

bad experiences later

I'm able to say ah every single time

there was a signal from the body

informing my mind

this is not good

now the reverse has also been true that

there have been a number of instances in

which I feel sort of immediate delight

and there's this kind of almost

astonishingly

simple experience of feeling comfortable

with somebody or at peace with something

or delighted at an experience and it

turns out all

literally all of those experiences and

people turned out to be experiences in

people that are still in my life and

that I

um still Delight in every day in other

words what's great about getting older

is that you stop questioning

the signals that come from the I think

deeper recesses of your nervous system

to say hey this is not good or hey this

is great more of this whereas I think in

my teens

my 20s my 30s I'm 40 almost 48 I'll be

48 next month

um

I I didn't trust I didn't listen I

actually put a lot of work into

overriding those signals and learning to

fight through them thinking that somehow

that was making me tougher or somehow

that was making me

um smarter when in fact in the end those

people that you meet that are you know

difficult or you know there are other

names for it you know it's like in here

like in the end you're like you're not a

person's piece of you know or

um this person is amazing and they're

really wonderful and I felt that from go

so you've learned to trust your gut

versus like the the influences of other

people's opinions um I've learned to

trust my gut versus the uh the forebrain

over analysis overriding the gut other

people often in my life have had great

Optics

right I've I've benefited tremendously

from an early age of being in a large

community of well it's been mostly guys

by some close female friends and always

have as well who will tell me that's a

bad decision where this person not so

good or be careful or they're great or

that's great so oftentimes my community

and the people around me have been more

aligned with the correct Choice than not

really yes really when you were younger

like like transparents and so on

I don't recall ever really listening to

my parents that much you know I grew up

in a you know we don't have to go back

to my childhood thing but my sense thank

you I learned that recently in a

psilocybin Journey

um my first my first high-dose

psilocybin Journey which was um welcome

back done with a clinician thank you

very much thank you I was worried there

for a second at one point in my not

coming back but in in any event

um yeah I grew up with some wild kids

you know I would say about a third of my

friends from childhood or dead or in

jail

um about a third have gone on to do

tremendously impressive things start

companies excellent athletes academics

um scientists and um and clinicians and

and then about a third are living their

lives has become more typical I just

mean um that they are happy family

people uh with jobs that they mainly

um serve the function to make money

they're not sort of career into their

career for career's sake but

um

so some of my friends early on gave me

some bad ideas

um but most of the time my bad ideas

came from

um

overriding the signals that I knew that

my body and I would say my body and

brain were telling me uh to obey and no

I say body and brain is that there's

this brain region the insula which um

that does many things but it represents

our sense of internal uh sensation in

terreception and I was talking to Paul

Conti about this you know as who as you

know

um I trim respect tremendously I think

he's one of the smartest people I've

ever met

um I think for different reasons he and

Mark Andreessen are some of the like

smartest people I've ever met but Paul's

level of insight into the human psyche

is is absolutely astounding and um and

um he

says the opposite of what most

people say about the brain which is most

people say oh the supercomputer of the

brain is the forebrain it's like a

monkey brain with a extra real estate

put on there and the forebrain is what

makes us human

um and gives us our our superpowers Paul

has said

um and he's done a whole series on

Mental Health that's coming out from our

uh podcast in September so this is not

an attempt to plug that but he'll

elaborate wait you're doing a thing with

fall we already did yeah so Paul oh nice

yeah so Paul Conte shot up uh we did it

he and I sat down he did a four episode

series on Mental Health this is not

mental illness mental health about how

to explore one's own subconscious

explore the self build and cultivate

um the generative Drive you'll learn

more about what that is from him he's

far more eloquent um and and clearer

than I am

um and he provides essentially a a set

of steps to explore the self that does

not require that you work with a

therapist this is self-exploration that

that is rooted in

Psychiatry it's rooted in neuroscience

and I don't think this information

exists anywhere else I'm not aware that

it exists anywhere else and um he

essentially distills it all down to one

uh eight and a half by eleven sheet

which we provide for people and

um

he says there I don't want to give too

much away because it I would detract

from what he does so beautifully but if

I tried and I want to accomplish it

anyway

um but he said and I believe that the

subconscious is the super computer of

the brain all the stuff working

underneath our conscious awareness

that's driving our feelings and our what

we think are the decisions that we've

thought through so carefully and that

only by exploring the subconscious and

understanding it a little bit

um can we actually uh

improve ourselves over time and I agree

I think that so that the mistake is to

think that thinking can override at all

it's a certain style of introspection

and thinking that um allows us to read

the signals from our body read the

signals from our brain integrate the the

knowledge that we're collecting about

ourselves and and to use all that in

ways that are really adaptive and

generative for us what do you think is

there in that subconscious well what do

you think of the younging as Shadow is

what what's there you know there's this

idea you're familiar with too I'm sure

that this jungian idea that there we all

have all things inside of us that all of

us have the capacity to be evil to be

good Etc but that some people Express

one or the other to a greater extent but

he also mentioned that there's a unique

category of people maybe two to five

percent of people that don't just have

all things inside of them but they

actually spend a lot of time exploring a

lot of those things the darker recesses

the Shadows their own Shadows

um

you know I'm somebody who's drawn to

goodness and to light into joy and all

those things like anybody else but I

think

um maybe it's part of how I grew up

maybe it was the crowd I was with

um

um maybe but then again you know even

when I started spending more time with

academics and scientists I mean

um you see shadows in other ways right

you see pure ambition with no passion I

I recall a colleague

um in San Diego who it was very clear to

me did not actually care about

understanding the brain but

understanding the brain was just his

Avenue to exercise ambition and if you

give him something else to work on he'd

work on that in fact he did he left and

he worked on something else I realized

he has no passion for understanding the

brain like all the I assumed all

scientists do certainly why I went into

it but some people it's just raw

ambition it's about winning it doesn't

even matter what they win to which to me

is crazy but I think that's a shadow

that some people explore not when I've

explored

um I think the shadow parts of us are

very important to come to understand and

look better to understand them and know

that they're there

and work with them then to not

acknowledge their presence and have them

surface in the form of addictions or

behaviors that um that damage Us in

other people so one of the processes for

achieving mental health is to bring

those things to the surface so fish the

subconscious mind yes and um and you

know he Paul describes 10 cupboards that

one can look into for exploring the self

there's the structure of self and the

function of self again this will all be

spelled out in the series in a lot of

detail also in terms of its relational

aspect between people how to pick good

partners and good relationship gets

really into this from a very different

perspective

um yeah fascinating stuff I was just

sitting there just I will say this that

that four episode series with Paul

is at least to date the most important

work I've ever been involved in

in all of my career because it's very

clear that we are not taught how to

explore our subconscious yeah and that

very few people actually understand how

to do that even most psychiatrists he

has a uh he mentioned something about

psychiatrists you know if you're a

cardiothoracic surgeon or something like

that and 50 of your patients die you're

considered a bad cardiothoracic surgeon

but with no disrespect to psychiatrists

there are there are some excellent

psychiatrists out there they're also a

lot of terrible psychiatrists out there

because unless all of those all of their

patients commit suicide or half commit

suicide they can treat for a long time

without it becoming visible that they're

not so good at their craft now he's

superb at his craft and

um I think he would say that yes

exploring some Shadows but also just

understanding the self like what what

you know really under understanding like

like who am I and and what's important

what are my ambitions what are my

striving again I'm lifting from some of

the things that that he'll describe

exactly how to do this

people do not spend enough time

addressing those questions and as a

consequence they discover what resides

in their subconscious through the

sometimes bad hopefully all also good

but um manifestations of their actions

they're we are driven by this huge

ninety percent of our real estate that

is not visible to our conscious

awareness and we we need to understand

that you know I've talked about this

before I've done therapy twice a week

since I was a kid I had to as a

condition of being let back in school

um I continue I found a way to either

through insurance or even when I didn't

have insurance I took an extra job

writing for Thrasher magazine when I was

a postdoc so I could pay for therapy at

a discount because I didn't make much

money as a postdoc I mean I think for me

it's as important as going to the gym

and people think it's just you know

ruminating on problems or getting

somewhere no no if you work with

somebody really good they're forcing you

to ask questions about who you really

are what you really want

um it's not just about support but there

should be support there should be

Rapport but then it's also

there should be Insight right most

people who get therapy they're getting

support there's rapport but Insight is

not easy to arrive at and a really good

psychologist or psychiatrist can help

you arrive at Deep insights that

transform your entire life well

sometimes when I look inside and I do

this often

you know exploring who you truly are you

come to this question

do I accept once you see parts do I

accept this or do I fix this is this a

is this who you are fundamentally

and it will always be this way or is

this a problem to be fixed like for

example one of the things

especially recently but in general over

time I've discovered about myself

probably has roots in childhood probably

has roots and a lot of things as I

deeply value loyalty

maybe more than the average person and

so when there's disloyalty it can be

painful to me and so this is who I am

and so do I have to

relax a bit

do I have to fix this part or is this

who you are and there's a million that's

one like little I think loyalty is a

good thing to cling to provided that

when loyalty is broken that it doesn't

um disrupt too many other areas of your

life but it depends also on who's

disrupting that loyalty if it's a

co-worker versus a romantic partner

versus your exclusive romantic partner

depending on the structure of your

romantic partner life you know I mean I

have always experienced extreme

um

joy and feelings of safety and Trust in

my friendships again mostly male

friendships what female friendships do

which is only to say that they were

mostly male friendships the female

friendships have also been very loyal

um let you know so getting backstabbed

is not something I'm familiar with

um and yeah I love being crewed up you

know yeah no for sure and I'm with you

and you know you and I are very much

have the same values on this but you

know that's one little thing and then

there's many other things like I'm

extremely self-critical and you look at

my you know I look at myself as I'm

regularly very self-critical there's a

self-critical engine in my brain and I

talked to actually Paul about this I

think on the podcast quite a bit and

he's saying this is a really bad thing

like you need to fix this you need to be

able to be regularly very uh positive

about yourself and I kept disagreeing

with them no this is like who I am like

you and it seems to work don't mess with

the thing that seems to be working it's

fine like I oscillate between being

really grateful and really self-critical

but then you have to like figure out

what is it maybe is there's a deeper

root thing there's maybe there's an

insecurity in there somewhere that has

to do with childhood and are you trying

to prove something to somebody from your

childhood this kind of thing well a

couple things that I think are

hopefully valuable for people here one

is

um

one way to destroy your life is to spend

time trying to control your or somebody

else's past

um so much of our destructive Behavior

and thinking comes from wanting

something that we saw or did or heard

to not be true

rather than really working with that and

getting close to what it really was and

you know sometimes those things are even

traumatic and we need to really get

close to them and and re for them to

move through us and and that you know

there are a bunch of different ways to

do that with support from others and

hopefully but sometimes on our own as

well I don't think we can rewire our

deep preferences and what we find

Despicable or joyful

I do think that

it's really a question of what allows us

peace like can you be at peace with the

fact that you're very self-critical and

enjoy that get some distance from it

have a sense of humor about it or is it

driving you in a way that's keeping you

awake at night and yeah um and forcing

you back to the table to do work in a

way that feels self-flagellating and

doesn't feel good

um you know can you get that humility

and awareness of how you're you know of

your one's flaws and I think that that

can create you know this word space

sounds very new age you like get space

from it you know you can have a sense of

humor about how how neurotic we can all

be I mean you know neurotic isn't

actually a bad term in the classic sense

of the psychologists and psychiatrists

the freudians said that you know the

best case is to be neurotic to actually

see one's own issues and work with them

whereas psychotic is the other is the

other way to be uh which is obviously

not good so I think um the question

whether or not to work on something or

to

um just accept it as part of ourselves I

think really depends if we feel like

it's holding us back or not and I I

think you're asking perhaps the most

profound question about being a human

which is you know what what do you do

with your body what do you do with your

mind I mean if you it's also a question

we started off talking about Fitness a

little bit we just for whatever reason

um you know

do I need to run an Ultra

you Marathon no I don't feel like I need

to

um David

Goggins does and and does a whole lot

more than that so that for him that's

important for me it's not important to

do that I don't think he does it just so

he can run the Ultras

um there's clearly something else in

there for him and guys like Kim Haynes

and and uh tremendous respect for for

what they do and how they do it

um

does one need to make their body more

muscular stronger more endurance more

flexibility do you need to read harder

books do you need to I think doing hard

things feels good

um I think it I know it feels good I

know that the worse I feel the worst way

to feel

is when I'm procrastinating and I don't

do something and then whenever I do

something and I complete it and I break

through that point where it was hard and

then I'm doing it at the end I actually

feel like I was infused with some sort

of

um super chemical and who knows if it's

probably a cocktail of endogenously made

chemicals but I think it is good to do

hard things but you have to be careful

not to destroy your body your mind in

the process and I think it's about

whether or not you can achieve peace can

you sleep well at night stress isn't bad

if you can sleep well at night you can

be stressed all day go go go go go go go

go and it'll optimize your focus but can

you fall asleep and stay deeply sleep at

night

um being in a hard relationship some

people say you know

that that's not good other people like

it can you be at peace in that and I

think uh we all you know I have

different RPM that you know we all kind

of idle at different RPM and

um some people are big mellow costellos

and others are kind of like you know

need more friction in order to to feel

at peace but I think ultimately what we

want is to feel at peace

I have um been through some really low

points over the past couple years and I

think

the reason could be boiled out

to the fact that I haven't been able to

find a place of peace a a place or

people or moments that give deep inner

peace

I yeah I you know

and I think you put it really

beautifully it's uh you have to figure

out given Who You Are

the various

um characteristics of your mind all the

things all the contents of the cupboards

uh how to how to get space from it and

ultimately one good representation of

that is to be able to laugh at all of it

whatever whatever's going on inside your

mind to be able to step back and just

kind of chuckle at the at the beauty and

the absurdity of the whole thing yeah

and keep going there's this beautiful uh

as I mentioned seems like every podcast

lately

um I'm a huge rancid fan mostly because

I just think Tim Armstrong's writing is

is pure poetry and whether or not you

like the music or not

um you know and he's written on music

for a lot of other people too he's not

doesn't advertise that much because he's

humble but I end up by the way I went to

a show of theirs like 20 years ago yeah

I'm going to see them in Boston in

September 18th I'm literally flying

there for for

um uh or I'll take the train up from New

York I'm gonna meet a friend of mine

named Jim thibo who's a big guy who owns

a lot of companies in skateboard

industry um we're meeting there like a

couple little kids to go see them play

amazing amazing people amazing music

music very intense very intense and but

embodies all the different emotions

that's why I love it right they have

some love songs they have some hate

songs they have some and um but you know

there's a going back to what you said I

think there's a there's a Psalm the

first song on the Indestructible album I

think it there's a

um it's sort of he's just talking about

like shock and disbelief of discovering

things about people that were close to

you and you know it's

um I won't I won't sing it but you know

nor I wouldn't dare but um but there's

this one lyric where that's really stuck

in my mind for for ever since that album

came out in 2003 which is

um you know

that nothing's what it seems so I just

sit here laughing I'm gonna keep going

on I can't get distracted there is this

piece of like you got to learn how to

push out the disturbing stuff sometimes

and go forward and I mean I remember

hearing that lyric and and then writing

it down and you know that was a time

where my undergraduate advisor who was

like a a mentor and a father to me you

know blew his head off in the bathtub

like three weeks before and then my

graduate advisor who I was working for

at that time who I loved and adored was

really like a mother to me I knew her

when she was pregnant with her two kids

died at 50. breast cancer and then my

postdoc advisor you know first day of

work at Stanford as a faculty member

sitting across the table like this from

him had a heart attack right in front of

me died of pancreatic cancer at the end

of 2017. I remember just thinking like

you know going back to that song lyric

over and over like and where people

would

um you know I haven't had many betrayals

in life I've had a few but just thinking

like we're seeing something or learning

something about something you just like

you can't believe it and I I I mentioned

that that lyric off that first song

Indestructible on that album because

it's this the emo like just the raw

emotion of like I can't believe this

what I just saw is so disturbing

but I have to just keep going forward

there are certain things that we really

do need to push not just into our

periphery but often to The Gutter and

keep going and that's a hard thing to

learn how to do but

if you're going to be functional in life

you have to and actually just to get at

this issue of do I change or do I

embrace this aspect of self

um about six months it was April

um

of this last year I did some intense

work around some things that were really

challenging to me and I did it alone and

it may have involved some medicine and I

expected to get peace through this I was

like I'm gonna let go of that and I

spent 11 hours just getting more and

more frustrated and angry about this

thing that I was trying to resolve and I

was so unbelievably disappointed that I

couldn't get that relief and I was like

what is this like this is not how this

is supposed to work

I'm supposed to be feel peace the clouds

are supposed to lift and so a week went

by

and then another half week went by and

then someone who I whose opinion I trust

very much I explained this to them

because I was getting a little concerned

like what's going on this is worse not

better and they said this is very simple

you have a giant blind spot

which is your sense of justice Andrew

and your sense of anger are linked like

an iron rod

and you need to relax it

and as they said that I felt the anger

dissipate and so there was something

that I think is it is true I have a very

strong sense of justice and my sense of

anger

then at least uh was very strongly

linked to it so it's great to have a

sense of justice right I hate to see

people wrong I absolutely do and I'm

human I'm sure I've wronged people in my

life I know I have they've told me I've

tried to apologize and reconcile where

possible still have a lot of work to do

um but

where I see Injustice it draws in my

sense of anger in a way that I think is

just eating me up and but it was only in

hearing that link that I wasn't aware of

before it was in my subconscious

obviously

um did I feel the relaxation it wasn't

there's no amount of plant medicine or

MDMA or any kind of you know chemical

you can take that's naturally just going

to dissipate what's hard for oneself it

needs if one Embraces that or if one

chooses to do it through just talk

therapy or journaling or friends or

introspection or all of the above there

needs to be an awareness of the things

that we're just not aware of so I think

the answer to your question do you

Embrace or do you fight these aspects of

self is

um I think you get in your subconscious

through good work with somebody skilled

or and sometimes that involves the tools

I just mentioned in various combinations

and you figure it out you figure out if

it's serving you obviously it was not

bringing me peace it was undermining my

my sense of justice was undermining my

sense of peace and so in understanding

this link be now I would say that the in

understanding this link between Justice

and anger now I think it's a little bit

more of like uh

you know it's not like a Twizzler stick

bendy but it's at least it's not like an

iron Rod like you know when I see

somebody wronged I mean it used to just

like like immediately but you're able to

step back now that's like to me the

ultimate place to reach

is laughter

I just sit here laughing exactly that's

that's the lyric I like I can't believe

it so I just sit here laughing like

can't get distracted just you just at

some point but the but the problem I

think in just laughing at something like

that gives you distance

but the question is

does do you stop engaging with it at

that point like I experienced this I

mean recently I got to see how sometimes

I'll see something that's just like what

like this is crazy so I just laugh but

then I continue to engage in it and it's

taking me off of course and so there is

a place where you know I mean I get

realize this is probably a kids show too

so I want to keep it you know G-rated

but it at some point for certain things

it makes sense to go

 that but also laugh at yourself for

saying that yeah and then move on

so the question is are you you get stuck

or do you move on sure right sure but

like there's a lightness of being that

comes with laughter I mean I've gotten

sure like as you know I spent the day

with Elon today he just gave me this

burnt hair do you know what this is I

have no idea I'm sure there's actually

this it should be a human lab episode on

this it's a cologne that's burnt hair

and it's like supposedly a really

intense smell and it is to please it's

not gonna leave you or no that's okay

well that's okay I'll take a whiff it as

if you have a chemical spray it on

yourself because I don't know if you can

so I'm reading an amazing book yeah

called an immense World by Ed young he

won a Pulitzer for uh we contain

multitudes or something like that I

think it's the title of the other book

um and the first chapter is all battle

faction and the incredible power that

olfaction has

that smells terrible I mean it doesn't

leave you ah for those listening it

doesn't quite smell terrible it's just

intense and it stays with you

this this to me represents like just

laughing at the absurdity of it all so I

have to ask so you were rolling Jiu

Jitsu yeah so is that fight between

um Elon and and azak actually going to

happen I think Elon is a huge believer

of this idea of uh the most entertaining

outcome is the most likely

and he almost like there's

almost the sense that there's not a free

will and the universe has a kind of

deterministic

gravitational field pulling towards the

most fun

and he's just a player in that game so

from that perspective I think it seems

like something like that is inevitable

like like a little scrap in the parking

lot of Facebook or something like

exactly sorry meta yeah but it looks

like they're they're training for real

and Zuck has competed right Jiu Jitsu so

um I think he is approaching it as a

sport yeah Elon is approaching it as a

spectacle and I mean the way he talks

about it he's a huge fan of History he

talks about all the Warriors that have

fought throughout history if you look he

wants to really do it at the Coliseum

and you know the Coliseum is for 400

years I was there's so many so much

great writing about this

um I think over 400 000 people have died

in the Coliseum Gladiators so this is

this historic place that sheds so much

blood so much fear so much anticipation

of battle all of this so he loves this

kind of spectacle and also the uh the

meme of it a hilarious absurdity of it

the two Tech CEOs are battling it out on

sand in a place where Gladiators fought

to the death and then Bears and Lions

eight prisoners as part of the execution

process what's also going to be an

instance where Mark Zuckerberg and Elon

Musk has changed bodily fluids

they bleed this one thing's about

fighting you know I think it was in um

that book it's great book a Fighter's

heart where he talks about you know sort

of the intimacy of of sparring I have I

only rolled Jiu Jitsu with you once but

there was a period of time where I boxed

and um which I don't recommend

um I got hit I hit some guys and I

definitely got hit back

um I'd Spar on Wednesday nights when I

lived on San Diego

um and

um you know when you spar with somebody

even if they hurt you especially if they

hurt you you know you see that person

afterwards and there's there's an

intimacy right you're it was it was in

that book Fire's heart where he explains

you know you're exchanging bodily fluids

with a stranger right and CR there's a

you're in your primitive mind and so

there's an intimacy there that that

persists so you go together through a

process of fear anxiety like yeah when

they get you you nod I mean you watch

somebody like catch somebody if you know

not so much in professional fighting but

if people are sparring that they catch

you you acknowledge that they caught you

like you got me there and on the flip

side of that so we trained and then

after that we played Diablo 4. I don't

know what that is I don't play video

games sorry but it's a video game so

it's like it's a um

you know pretty intense combat in the

video you're fighting like demons okay

last video game played was Mike Tyson's

punch out there you go that's pretty I

met him recently went on his podcast you

want you want wait it hasn't come out

yet oh it hasn't come yeah okay yeah I

asked um Mike

um his kids are great they came in

they're super smart kids goodness

gracious they ask great questions

um asked Mike what he did with the piece

of evander's ear that that he bit off

did you remember yeah he's like get back

to him here you go sorry about that he

sells Edibles that are in the shape of

ears with a little bite out of it

um yeah that his his life has been

incredible he's um uh and I met yeah he

he his family you get the sense that

they're really a great family they're

really um Mike Tyson that's a heck of a

journey right there of a man yeah my now

friend Tim Armstrong like I said leads

to hearing from ranty he put it best he

said you know that Mike Tyson's life is

you know Shakespearean and you know down

up down up and just that the arcs of his

life are just like sort of an only in

America kind of tale too right so

speaking of Shakespeare I've recently

gotten to know Neri oxman who's this

incredible uh scientist that works at

the intersection of Nature and

engineering and

she uh reminded me of this uh Anna ahmat

of a line This is this great Soviet poet

that I really love from uh over a

century ago that each of Our Lives is a

Shakespearean drama raised to the

Thousand degree so I have to ask why do

you think humans are attracted to

this kind of Shakespearean drama

is there some aspect we've been talking

about the subconscious mind that that

pulls us towards

the drama even though the place of

mental health is peace

yes and yes do you have some of that

draw towards drama

yeah

if you look at the empirical data yes I

mean right if I look at the empirical

data I mean I think about who I chose to

work for as an undergraduate right I was

a you know barely finished high school

finally get to College

barely I think this is really

embarrassing and not something to Aspire

to you know I was

um you know thrown out of the dorms for

fighting

um I barely passed my classes you know

the girlfriend and I split up I mean I

was living in a squad got into a big

fight it was getting in trouble with the

law I eventually got my act together go

back to school start working for

somebody who do I choose to work for a

guy who's an ex-navy guy who smokes

cigarettes in the fume Hood drinks

coffee and we're injecting rats with

MDMA yeah and you know I was drawn to

like the personality his energy but I

also he was a great he was a great

scientist worked out a lot on a thermal

regulation in the brain and

um and more

um you know go to graduate school I'm

working for somebody and

decide that yeah doing working in her

laboratory wasn't quite right for me so

I'm literally sneaking into the

laboratory next door and working for the

woman next door because I like the

relationships that she had to a certain

set of questions and she was a kind of a

quirky person and you know so drawn to

drama but drawn to I like characters I

like people that have texture yeah and

I'm not drawn to Raw ambition I'm

drawing people that seem to have a real

passion for what they do and a

uniqueness to them that I I you know you

can kind of not kind of I'll just say

how it is I can feel their heart for

what they do and I'm I'm drawn to that

like um and that can be good

the same reason I went to work for Ben

Barris as a postdoc it wasn't because he

was the first transgender Man member of

the National Academy of Sciences that

was just a feature of who he was I loved

how he loved glea he would talk about

these cells like they were the most

enchanting things that he'd ever seen in

his life and I was like this is like the

biggest nerd I've ever met and I love

him

I think we're Dr I'm drawn to that

um this is another thing that Conti

makes uh elaborates on quite a bit more

in the series on Mental Health coming

out but there are different drives

within us there's this

there are aggressive drives not always

for fighting but for intense interaction

I mean look at Twitter look at some of

look at people clearly have an

aggressive Drive there's also a pleasure

Drive some people also have a strong

pleasure Drive they want to experience

pleasure through food through sex

through friendship through Adventure you

know but I think the Shakespearean drama

is the drama of the different drives in

different ratios in different people I I

know somebody and she's incredibly kind

has an extremely high pleasure Drive

loves taking great care of herself and

people around her through food and

through Retreats and through all these

things and makes spaces beautiful

everywhere she goes and is gifts these

things that are just so unbelievably

feminine and incredible these gifts to

people and the kind and thoughtful about

what they like and then

um but I would say very little

aggressive Drive

um from my read and then I know other

people who are just have a ton of

aggressive drive and very low pleasure

drive and I think so there's this

alchemy that exists where people have

these things in different ratios and

then you blend in

um you know the differences in the

chromosomes and differences in hormones

and differences in personal history and

what you end up with is a species

that

creates incredible recipes of drama but

also peace also relief from drama

contentment I mean I realize this isn't

the exact topic of the question but

um someone I know

very dearly actually an ex-girlfriend of

mine long-term partner mine

um sent me something recently I think it

hit the nail on the head which is that

ideally

for a man they eventually settle where

they find and feel peace or they feel

peaceful where they can be themselves

and feel peaceful now I'm sure there's a

equivalent or mirror image of that for

women but this particular post that she

sent was about men and I totally agree

and so

um it isn't always that we're seeking

friction but

for periods of our life we see friction

drama Adventure excitement

fights

um you know

and doing hard hard things and then I

think at some point I'm certainly coming

to this point now where it's like yeah

that's all great and checked a lot of

boxes but had a lot of close calls flew

really close to the Sun on a lot of

things with life and limb and and part

and spirit and some of you know people

close to us didn't make it and sometimes

not making it means their the career

they wanted went off a cliff or the the

their health went off a cliff or their

life went off a cliff but I think that

um there's also the Shakespearean drama

of the characters that exit the play and

are living their lives happily in the

backdrop it just doesn't make for as

much entertainment

that's one other thing that's a benefit

you could say is the benefit of getting

older is uh

um finding the Shakespearean drama less

appealing or finding the joy in the

peace yeah definitely I mean I think

that

um I think there's real peace with age I

think the other thing is this notion of

checking boxes is a real thing I for me

anyway I I have a morning meditation

that I do

um well I wake up now I get my sunlight

I hydrate I use the bathroom I do all

the things that I talk about

um I've started to practice a prayer in

the last year which is new ish for me

which is we could talk about in the

morning yeah can you talk about it a

little bit sure yeah and I and then I

have a meditation that I do that

actually is where I think through with

the different roles that I play so I

like I start very basic

um I say okay I'm an animal like we are

we are like biologically animals right

human

you know I'm a man I'm a scientist I'm a

teacher I'm a friend I'm a brother I'm a

son you know I go through this I have

this list and I think about the

different roles that I have and the

roles that I still want in my life going

forward that I haven't yet fulfilled it

just takes me it's sort of an inventory

of where I've been where I'm at and

where I'm going as they say

um and I don't know why I do it but I

started doing it this last year I think

because

um it helps me understand just how many

different uh contexts I have to exist in

and and remind myself that there's still

more that I haven't done that I'm

excited about So within each of those

contexts there's like things that you

want to kind of accomplish to Define

that yeah and I'm ambitious so I think

you know I'm a brother I have an older

sister and I love her tremendously and I

think I want to be the best brother I

can be to her which means maybe a call

maybe just

um you know we do an annual trip

together for our birthdays our birthdays

are close together we always go to New

York for our birthdays if we've gone for

last three four years like really like

reminding myself of that role not

because I'll forget but because I have

all these other roles I'll get pulled

into I say the first one I'm an animal

because I have to remember that I have a

body that needs care

like any of us I need sleep I need food

I need hydration I need that I'm human

that that the brain of a human is is

marvelously complex but also

um marvelously uh self-defeating at

times and so I've been thinking about

these things in the context of the

different roles and the whole thing

takes about four or five minutes and I

just find it brings me a certain amount

of clarity that then allows me to

ratchet into the day the prayer piece um

yeah I think I've been reluctant to talk

about

um until now

um because I don't believe in pushing

religion on people and

um and I think that

um and I'm not

um it's a highly individual thing and I

do believe that one can be an atheist

and still pray

um or agnostic and still pray but uh for

me it really came about through

understanding that there are certain

aspects of myself

that I just couldn't

resolve on my own and no matter how much

therapy no matter how much and I haven't

done a lot of it but no matter how much

plant medicine or other sorts of

medicine or exercise or

um podcasting or science or friendship

or any of that I was just not going to

resolve and so

um I started this because uh someone

close to me

um said a male friend said you know

prayer is powerful

and I said well how and I said I don't

know how but if you if you can get it

can allow you to Get outside yourself

get let you give up control and at the

same time take control I don't even like

saying take control but the whole notion

is that

again forgive me but there's no other

way to say it the whole notion is that

you know like God works through US

whatever God is to you he he him her

whatever the life force nature whatever

it is to you right that it works through

us and so I do a prayer I'll just

describe it where I I ask

um I make an ask to help remove my

defects my Character defects I I pray to

God to help remove my Character defects

so that I can show up

um better in all the roles of my life

and do good work like to which for me is

learning and teaching learning and

teaching and and so you might say well

how is that different than a meditation

well it I'm acknowledging that there is

something that bigger than me bigger

than nature as I understand it that I

cannot understand or control nor do I

want to and I'm just giving over to that

and does that make me less of a

scientist I I sure tell hope not I

certainly know I there's the head of our

neurosciences at Stanford until recently

um I you should talk to him directly

about it Bill Newsom has talked about

his religious life

um for me it's really a way of getting

outside myself and then understanding

how I fit into this bigger picture and

it's and the Character defects part is

real right I'm a human I have defects

like

I got a lot of flaws in me like anybody

but

um and trying to acknowledge them and

asking for help in removing them not

magically but through right action

through my right action

so I do that every morning and um I have

to say that it's helped it's helped a

lot it's helped me be better to myself

be better at other people

um I still make mistakes

um but it's a it's becoming a bigger

bigger part of my life and I never

thought I'd talk like this

um but

I think

it's clear to me that

if we don't

believe in something

again doesn't have to be traditional

standardized religion but if we don't

believe in something bigger than

ourselves we uh at some level will

self-destruct

I really I really think so it's power

and it's powerful in a way that all the

other stuff meditation and all the tools

is is not because it's really operating

at a much deeper and bigger level and um

you know if

yeah I think I think that's all I can

talk about it um mostly because I'm

still working out you know the

scientists in me wants to understand how

it works and I want to understand and

the point is to just go you know

there's some there's you know for lack

of a better language for it there's

higher power than me and what I can

control I'm giving up control on certain

things and somehow that restores a sense

of agency

for for right action better action I

think perhaps a part of that is just the

humility that comes with acknowledging

there's something bigger and more

powerful than you and then you can't

control everything yeah it's I mean that

you go through life as a hard driving

person you know forward Center of mass I

remember being that way since I was

little it's like a new LEGOs I'm like

all the Lego so it's like on the

weekends you know learning about

medieval weapons and giving lectures

about it in class when I was five or six

years old we're learning about tropical

fish and you know cataloging all of them

at the store and then organizing it and

making my you know my dad drive me or my

mom drive me to some fish store and then

spending all my time there until they

throw me out you know all of that but I

also remember my entire life I would

secretly pray

when things were good and things weren't

good but mostly when things weren't good

because it's important to pray for me

it's important to pray each morning

regardless but when things

weren't right I couldn't get make sense

of them I would secretly pray but I felt

kind of ashamed of that for whatever

reason and then it was once in college I

distinctly remember I I was having a

hard time with a number of things

um and I took a run

down to Sans Beach it was UC Santa

Barbara and I remember I just I was like

I don't know if I even have the right to

to do this but I'm just praying I just

prayed for uh

the ability to be as brutally honest

with myself

and with other people as I possibly

could be about a particular situation I

was in at that time

I mean I I think now it's probably safe

to say I'd gone off to college because

of a high school girlfriend we'd she

essentially she was my family more

frankly more than my biological family

was at a certain stage of life and we'd

reached a point where we were diverging

and it was it was incredibly painful it

was like losing everything I had and I

was like what do I do how do I manage

this do I you know I was ready to quit

and join the Fire Service just to

support us so we could move forward and

and

um and you know it's just but praying

just saying I can't figure this out on

my own it's sort of like I can't think

of this out on my own and how

frustrating that is no number of friends

could tell me or and inner wisdom

couldn't tell me and eventually led me

to the right answers and she and I are

friendly friends to this day she's

happily married with a child and

um we're on good terms but I think

you know it's

it's a it's a scary thing but it's the

best thing when you I can't control all

this and asking for help I think is also

the piece you're not asking for some

magic hand to come down and take care of

it you're asking for the help to come

through you right so that your body is

used to do these right works right

action isn't it interesting that this

secret thing that you're almost

embarrassed by that you did it as a

child is something you oh man it's

another thing you do as you get older is

you realize like those things are part

of you and it's actually a beautiful

thing yeah a lot of the content of the

podcast is you know deep epic content

and we talk about everything from you

know uh Eating Disorders to bipolar

disorder to depression you know a lot of

different topics but the tools are the

protocols as we say right the sunlight

viewing all the rest

um you know a lot of that stuff is just

stuff I wish I had known when I was in

graduate school if I'd known to go

outside every once in a while and get

some sunlight not just stay in the lab

I would have you know I might not have

hit a like a really tough round of

depression when I was a postdoc and

working twice as hard and you know when

my body would break down or I'd get sick

a lot I don't get sick Much Anymore

occasionally about once every 18 months

to two years I get I'll get something

but

um

learn you know I used to break my foot

skateboarding all the time I couldn't

understand what's wrong with my body I'm

getting injured I can't do what everyone

else can now I developed more slowly at

a long Arc of puberty

um but I so that was part of it I was

still developing but you know how to get

your body stronger how to build

endurance that no one told me the

information wasn't there so a lot of

what I put out there is the information

that I wish I had had because once I had

it I was like wow like a this stuff

really works B it's grounded in

something real you know some place

sometimes certain Protocols are a

combination of you know animal human and

animal and human studies sometimes

clinical trials sometimes there's some

mechanistic conjecture for some not all

I always make clear which but in the end

like

figuring out how things work so that we

can be happier healthier more productive

suffer less like reduce the suffering of

the world

um and I think that

well I'll just say thank you and um for

asking about the prayer piece

um

again I'm not pushing or even

encouraging it on anyone I've just found

it to be tremendously useful for me

you know I mean about prayer in general

you said information and uh figuring out

how to get stronger healthier smarter

all those kinds of things a part of me

believes that deeply you know you can

gain a lot of knowledge and wisdom

through learning

but a part of me believes that all the

wisdom I need was all was there when I

was

11 and 12 years old

and then it got cluttered over well

listen I can't wait for you and Conti to

talk again because

when he gets going about the

subconscious and the amount of this that

sits below the surface like an iceberg

and

and I and the fact that when we're kids

we're not

obscuring a lot of that subconscious as

much and and sometimes that can look a

little more primitive I mean I mean a

kid that's disappointed will let you

know a kid that's excited will let you

know and you feel that raw exuberance or

that raw dismail and I think that

um as we grow older we learn to cover

that stuff up we we wear masks and we

have to to be functional right I don't

think we all want to go around just

being completely

um raw but as you said as you get older

you also you get to this point where

you're gonna go

you know what what are we really trying

to protect anyway I mean I have this

theory that

you know certainly my experience has

taught me that a lot of people

but

I'll talk about men because that's what

I know best

whether or not they show up strong or

not

that they're really afraid of

being weak like they're just afraid like

sometimes the strength is even a way to

try and not be weak right which is

different than being strong for its own

sake I'm not just talking about physical

strength I'm talking about intellectual

strength I'm talking about money I'm

talking about

um

expressing Drive I've been watching this

um series a little bit of uh chimp

Empire oh yeah so chimp Empire is

amazing right they have the head champ

he's not the head chimp but the the the

alpha in the group yeah and he's getting

older and so what does he do every once

in a while he goes on these Vigor

displays he goes and he grabs Branch he

starts breaking him he starts thrashing

him and he's incredibly strong and

they're all kind of like watching I mean

yeah I immediately think of people like

they're dead lifting on Instagram and I

just think the displays a Vigor this is

just the primate sewing that displays

the figure now what's interesting is

that he's doing that specifically to say

hey I still have what it takes to lead

this troop okay then they're the the

ones that are subordinate to him but not

so not so far behind it seems to be that

there's a very clear like numerical

ranking there is like it's it's clear

who's the number two number three yeah I

mean who gets to mate first who gets to

eat first this exists in other animal

societies too but uh Bob sapolski would

be a great person to talk about this

with because he knows obviously

tremendous amount about it and I I know

just the top Contour but

um yeah so number two three and four

males are

aware that he's doing these Vigor

displays but they're also aware because

in primary Evolution they got some extra

forebrain too not as much as us but they

got some and they're aware that the

Vigor displays are displays that because

they've done them as well in a different

context might not just be displays of

vigor but might also be an insurance

policy against people seeing weakness

okay so now they start using that

prefrontal cortex to do some interesting

things so in in primate world if a male

is friendly with another man wants to

affiliate with him and say hey I'm

backing you they'll go over and they'll

they'll pick off the little

um parasites and eat them and so the

grooming is extremely important in fact

if they want to ostracize or kill one of

the members of their

um troop they will just leave it alone

no one will groom it and then there's

actually a really disturbing sequence in

that show of then the parasites start to

eat away on their skin they get

infections they have issues no one will

mate with them no one they have other

issues as well and can potentially die

so the interesting thing is is number

two and three start to line up a

strategy to groom this guy but

they are actually thinking about over

taking the entire troop setting in a new

Alpha but

the current Alpha did that to get where

he is so he knows that they're doing

this grooming thing but they're not

might not be sincere about the grooming

so what does he do he takes the whole

troop on a raid to another troop and

sees who will fight for him and who

won't this is advanced

Contracting of behavior

for a species that normally we don't

think of as as sophisticated as us so

it's very interesting and it gets to

something that I hope will have an

opportunity to talk about because it's

something that I'm obsessed with lately

is this notion of overt versus covert

contracts right there are overt

contracts where you exchange work for

money or you exchange any number of

things in an overt way but then there

are covert contracts um and those take

on a very different form and always lead

to uh in my belief bad things well how

much of human and chimp relationships

are over versus covert well here's one

thing that we know is true

dogs and humans the dog to human

relationship is 100 overt they don't

manipulate you now you could say they do

in the sense that they learn that if

they look a certain way or roll on their

back they get food but there's no

um there's no banking of that behavior

for a future date where then they are

going to undermine you and take your

position okay so in that sense dogs can

be a little bit manipulative in some

sense but

um now okay so overt contract

would be

we both want to do some work together

we're going to make some money you get X

percentage I get X percentage it's overt

covert contract

which is in my opinion bad always bad

would be we're gonna do some work

together you're gonna get a percentage

of money I'm gonna get a percentage of

money

could look just like the overt contract

but secretly I'm resentful that I got

the percentage I got

so what I start doing is covertly taking

something else what do I take maybe I

take the opportunity to jab you verbally

every once in a while maybe I take the

opportunity to show up late maybe I take

the opportunity to get to know one of

your co-workers so that I might start a

business with them that's covert

Contracting and you see this sometimes

in romantic relationships one person we

won't set the male or female in any

direction here and just say

it's I'll make you feel powerful if you

make me feel desired okay great there's

nothing explicitly wrong about that

contract if they both know and they both

agree but what if it's I'll do that but

I'll have kids with you so you feel

powerful you'll have kids with me so I

feel desired but secretly I don't want

to do that

or they one person says I don't want to

do that or both don't so what they end

up doing is saying okay so I expect

something else I expect you to do

certain things for me or I expect you to

pay for certain things for me covert

contracts are the signature of

everything bad overt contracts are the

signature of all things good yeah and I

think about this a lot because I've seen

a lot of examples of this I've

like anyone we participate in these

things whether or not we want to or not

and the thing that gets transacted the

most

is

well I should say the things that get

transacted the most are the overt things

you'll see money

um time

sex

um property

whatever happens to be information but

what ends up happening is that when

people I believe don't feel safe they

feel threatened in some way like it's

they don't feel safe in a certain

interaction what they do is they start

taking something else

while still engaging in in the exchange

and I'll tell you

if there's one thing about human nature

that's bad it's that

feature why that feature or is it a bug

or a feature as you Engineers like to

say

um I think it's because we were

allocated a certain extra amount of

prefrontal Cortex that makes us more

sophisticated than a dog

more sophisticated than a chimpanzee but

they do it too and

it's because it's often harder

to deal with in the short term to deal

with the real sense of this is scary

this feels threatening than it is to

play out all the iterations it takes a

lot of brain work you're playing chess

and go simultaneously trying to figure

out where things are going to end up and

we just don't know so it's a way I think

of creating a false sense of certainty

but I'll tell you covert contracts the

only certainty is that it's going to end

badly the question is how badly

conversely overt contracts always end

well

always the problem with overt contracts

is that you can't be certain that the

other person is not engaging in a covert

contract you can only take

responsibility for your own Contracting

well one of the challenges of being

human is looking at another human being

and figuring out

the way their way of being their

behavior which of the two types of

contracts it represents because they

look awfully the same on the surface and

it's one of the one of the challenges of

being human is the decision we all make

is are you somebody that takes a leap of

trust and trusts other humans that are

willing to take the hurt are you going

to be cynical and skeptical and avoid

most interactions until they're uh they

over a long period of time prove your

trust yeah I never liked the phrase

history repeats itself

um when it comes to humans because it

doesn't apply if the people or the

person is actively working to resolve

their own flaws I do think that if

people are willing to do dedicated

introspective work go into their

subconscious

do the hard work have hard conversations

and get better at hard conversations

something that I'm constantly trying to

get better at I think people can change

but they have to want to change it does

seem like

deep down we all can kind of tell the

difference between over and covert like

we have a good sense I think one of the

benefits of having this characteristical

mind where I value loyalty I've been

extremely uh fortunate to spend most of

my life in overt relationships and I

think that creates a really fulfilling

life but there's also this thing that

maybe we're in this uh portion of the

podcast now but

um this is late at night we're talking

that's right certainly late for me but

I'm two hours I came in today on uh I'm

still in California we should also say

that you came here to wish me a happy

birthday I did I did I and the podcast

is just like a a fun last minute thing I

suggested yeah some um close friends of

yours have arranged a dinner that I'm

really looking forward to I won't say

which night but it's the next couple of

nights

um you know your circadian clock

um is one of the most robust features of

your biology I know you can be nocturnal

or you can be diurnal we know you're

mostly nocturnal um at certain times of

the year relaxed but

um but they're very very few people can

get away with no sleep very few people

can get away with a chaotic sleep wake

schedule so you have to obey a 24-hour

AKA circadian uh Rhythm um if you want

to remain healthy of Mind and Body we

also have to acknowledge that it's

aging is in linear

right so um what do you mean well I mean

you the the degree of change between

years 35 and 40 is not going to be the

degree of change between 40 and 45 but I

will say this

I'm 48 and I feel better in every aspect

of my psychology and biology

now than I did when I was in my 20s

yeah sort of quality of of thought

um time spent

um physically I can do what I did then

which is probably says more about what I

could do then than what I can do now but

if you keep training you can continue to

get better the key is to not get injured

and I I've never trained super hard I've

trained hard but I've been cautious to

not for instance weight train more than

two days in a row I do a split which

basically three days a week and the

other day is a run take one full day off

take a week off every 12 to 16 weeks

I've not been the guy hurling the

heaviest weights or running the furthest

distance but I have been the guy who's

continuing to do it when a lot of my

friends are talking about knee injuries

hey hey hey

but of course with sport you can't

account for everything the same way you

can with Fitness and and I have to

acknowledge that you know

um unless one is power lifting you know

weight lifting and running you can get

hurt but it's not like skateboarding

where if you if you're going for you're

gonna get hurt that's just you're

landing on concrete and

um it with Jiu Jitsu like people are

trying to hurt you so that you say stop

um so with a sport it's different

um and these days I don't really do a

sport any longer

um I work out

um to stay fit I I used to

um continue to do sports but I kept

getting hurt and frankly now like a

rolled ankle

um

I may put out a little small skateboard

part in 2024 because people have been

saying we want to see the kickflip you

want to say well I'll do a heel flip

instead but okay

um uh I might put out a little part

because some of the guys that work on

our podcast are from DC I think by now I

I I should at least do it just to show

like I'm not making it up

um and I probably will but I think that

doing a sport is different that's how

you get hurt

overuse and doing it an actual sport and

so you know hat tip to those do an

actual sport

and that's a difficult decision like I a

lot of people have to make I have to

make with Jiu Jitsu for example like if

you just look empirically I've trained

really hard from all my life and

grappling Sports and fighting Sports and

all this kind of stuff and I've avoided

injury for the most part and I would say

I would attribute that to

um training a lot sounds

counterintuitive but training well and

safely and correctly keeping good form

saying no and I need to say no but

training a lot and taking it seriously

now when this training is kind of a side

really a side thing I find that the

injury is uh becomes a higher and higher

probability when you're just doing it

every once in a while every once in a

while yeah that I think you said

something really important that the um

saying no I mean the times I have gotten

hurt training is when someone's like hey

let's hop on this workout together and

it becomes uh let's challenge each other

to do something outrageous

um sometimes that can be fun though I

went up to cam haines's gym and he does

these very high repetition weight

workouts that are in circuit form I was

sore for two weeks but

um I learned a lot and didn't get

injured and um and yes we ate bow hunted

elk afterwards nice but the the injury

has been a really difficult

psychological thing for me because um

so I've injured my uh my finger pinky

fingered my knee yeah your kitchen is

filled with splints splints I'm trying

to figure I'm trying to figure out

it's like if you look at Lex's kitchen

there's there's some really good snacks

I had some right before

um he's very good about keeping cold

drinks in the fridge

um and all the water has element in it

which is great I love that

um but then there there's a whole like

Hospital's worth of splints yeah I'm

trying I'm trying to figure out so

here's the thing you uh I think like pop

out like this right uh pinky finger I'm

trying to figure out how do I splint in

such a way that I can still program

still play guitar

but protect this kind of torque motion

that creates a huge amount of pain and

that's a bit of a jiu jitsu injury

Jiu-Jitsu but it's a it's not the kind

of it's probably more like a

skateboarding style injury which is

it's unexpected in a silly in a silly

thing that happens in a second I didn't

break my foot doing anything important

Yeah I broke my

fifth minute stepping off a curb so it's

that's why they're called accidents

yeah if you get hurt doing something

awesome that's a trophy yeah that you

have to work through it's part of your

payment to the universe

if you get hurt stepping off a curb or

you know doing something stupid

called a stupid accent

since we brought up chimp Empire let me

ask you about relationships

I think we talked about relationships

yeah I only date Homo sapiens

uh the morning meditation the night is

still young you are human no but you are

also animal

don't sell yourself short no I always

say listen any discussion on the human

Lab podcast about sexual health or

anything I always be the the critical

Force consensual age-appropriate context

appropriate species appropriate species

appropriate well can I just tell you

about sexual selection

um I've been watching Life in Color with

David Attenborough because I've been

watching a lot of nation documentaries

talking about inner peace it brings me

so much peace to watch nature and it's

worse than at its best so Life in Color

is a series on Netflix where

it presents some of the most colorful

animals on Earth and kind of tells their

story of how they got there through

natural selection so you know you have

the peacock with the feathers and it's

just such incredible colors like the

peacock has these

uh tail feathers uh the male

that are like gigantic and they're super

colorful and they're these eyes

on on it it's not eyes it's like I like

areas and and they wiggle their ass like

to show the Tails they wiggle the tails

the eye spots the eye spots yes thank

you you know this probably way better

than me I'm just quoting it no David at

least continue but it was it's just I'm

watching this and then the female is as

boring looking as pot like she has no

colors or nothing but she's standing

there bored just seeing this entire

display and I'm just wondering like the

entirety of life on Earth or not the

entirety post-bacteria is like

in at least in part maybe in a large

part can be described through this

process of natural selection of sexual

selection so

dudes fighting

and then women selecting it seems like

it's just the the entirety of that

series shows some incredible birds and

insects and shrimp they're all beautiful

and colorful and just a shrimp Manta

shrimp they're just they're incredible

and it's all about getting laid it's

fascinating like I just

um and there's nothing like watching

that and Champa Empire to make you

realize we humans that's the same thing

that's all we're doing and all the

beautiful variety all the bridges in the

buildings and the rockets and the

internet all of that is this kind is is

at least in part this kind of uh a

product of this kind of showing off for

each other

and all the wars and all this anyway uh

well there's that I'm asking oh

relationships well right um before you

ask about relationship I think what's um

clear is that every species it seems

animal species wants to make more of

itself and protect its young

with the protect this young is

non-obvious so not destroy enough

um of itself uh that it can't get more

to reproductive competent age I mean I

think that

you know we have a natural I mean

healthy people have a natural reflex to

protect

children

well I don't know and those that can't

wait a minute wait wait wait wait a

minute I've seen enough animals that are

murdering the children sure some other

sure there's even simplicide they're

like

first of all I just want to say that I I

was um delighted in your Delight around

Animal Kingdom stuff because this is a

favorite uh theme of mine as well but

there's for instance

some fascinating uh data on for instance

uh for those that grew up on farms

they'll be familiar with free Martins

you know about free Martins this is

they're cows that have multiple

um calves inside them and there's a

situation in which the calves will

secrete if there's more than one inside

will secrete chemicals that will

um hormonally castrate the cap next to

them so they can't reproduce so already

in the womb they are fighting for future

resources that's how early this stuff

can start so it's chemical warfare in

the womb Against The Sibling sometimes

there's outright sibilicide siblings are

born they kill one another

um this also becomes biblical stories

right

um there are instances of cuttlefish

beautiful cephalopods like octopuses um

and that is the plural as we yeah um

the internet oh yeah that became a meme

or a little discussion yeah pretty quick

oh yeah and now we just resurfaced it

that's great the dismay in your voice is

so amusing

um in any event that the male cuttlefish

will disguise themselves by as female

cuttlefish infiltrate the female

cuttlefish uh

um group and then mate with them you

know

um all sorts of

um you know

types of covert uh operations so I think

that

combat it's like a drinking game where

every time we say covert in a contract

in this uh episode you have to take a a

shot of espresso please don't do that

you'd be dead by the end

um so it actually is just a small

tangent it does make me wonder how much

intelligence covert contracts require it

seems like not much if they if we could

if you can do it in the animal kingdom

there's some kind of instinctual it is

based perhaps in like fear yeah it could

be um simple algorithm if if you know if

there's some ambiguity about numbers and

I'm not with these guys and you know

then flip to the alternate strategy I

actually have a story about this that I

think is relevant I used to have

cuttlefish in my lab in San Diego uh we

went and got them from a guy out in the

desert we put them in the lab is amazing

and they I had a postdoc who was

studying prey capturing cuttlefish they

have a very ballistic extremely rapid

strike and grab of the shrimp and they

um we were using high speed cameras uh

to to characterize all this looking at

binocular they normally have their eyes

on the side of their head when they see

something they want to eat the eyes

translocate to the front which allows

them stereopsis depth perception allows

them to strike we were doing some

unilateral eye removals they would miss

Etc okay

this has to do with eye spots

this was during a government shutdown

period where the ghost shrimp that they

normally

um feed on that we would ship in from

the Gulf down here weren't available to

us so we had to get different shrimp and

what we noticed was the the Cuttlefish

normally would just sneak up on the

shrimp we learned this by data

collection and if the shrimp was facing

them they would do this thing with their

tentacles of kind of enchanting the

cuddle the the shrimp and if the shrimp

wasn't facing them they wouldn't do it

and they would ballistically grab it and

and eat them

well when we got these new shrimp the

new shrimp had eye spots on their tails

and then the Cuttlefish would do this

kind of attempt to enchant regardless of

the position of the ghost shrimp so what

does that mean okay well it means that

there's some sort of algorithm in the

cuttlefish's mind that says okay if you

see two spots move your tentacles so it

can be as you pointed out it can be a

fairly simple operation but it looks

diabolical it looks cunning but all it

is is strategy B

yeah but it's still somehow

emerged I mean I I I don't think that

it's like calling it an algorithm

doesn't I feel like well there's a

circuit there that gets implemented in a

certain context but that circuit had to

evolve you do realize it super

intelligent AI will look at us humans

and we'll say the exact thing there's a

circuit in there that evolved to do this

the algorithm a and algorithm B and it's

trivial and to us humans it's fancy and

beautiful where I poetry about it but

it's because so we don't understand the

subconscious because they want that AI

algorithm cannot see into what it can't

see it doesn't understand the

underworkings of what allows all of this

conversation stuff to manifest and we

can't even see it how could AI see it

maybe it will maybe maybe AI will solve

and give us access to our subconscious

maybe your AI friend or coach like I

think Andreessen and others are are

arguing is going to happen at some point

it's going to say Hey you know Lex

you're making decisions lately that are

not good for you but it's because of

this

algorithm that you picked up in

childhood that if you don't State your

explicit needs up front

you're not going to get what you want so

why do it from now on you need to

actually make a list of every absolutely

outrageous thing that you want no matter

how outrageous and communicate that

immediately and that will work we're

talking about coefficient sexual

selection and then we went into some uh

where do we go well and you said you

were excited I was I was I was excited

well you were just saying what about

these these covert contracts and animals

do them I think it's simple contextual

engagement of a neural circuit which is

not just nerd speak for saying they do a

different strategy saying that there has

to be a circuit there hardwired circuit

maybe learned but probably hardwired

that can be engaged right you can't

build neural Machinery out of in a

moment

um you need to build that circuit over

time what is building it over time you

select for it the the Cuttlefish that

did not have that alternate context

driven circuit didn't survive when there

was a uh when all the shrimp that they

normally disappear here in the ice

spotted shrimp showed up and there were

a couple that had some miswiring this is

why mutation right X-Men type stuff is

real

um they had a mutation they had some

alternate wiring and that wiring got

selected before it became a mutation

that was adaptive as opposed to male

adaptive this is something people don't

often understand about genetics is that

it only takes a few generations to

devolve a trait make it worse but it

takes a long time to evolve an Adaptive

trait there are exceptions to that but

most often that's true so a species

needs a lot of generations we are

hopefully still evolving as a species

and it takes a long time but uh to

evolve more adaptive traits but doesn't

take long to to devolve

adaptive traits so that you're getting

sicker or you're not functioning as well

so choose your mate wisely and that's

perhaps a good segue into sexual

selection humans I could tell you you're

good at this

uh who said well why did I bring up

sexual selection it's good relationship

so um it's extra selection in humans

even I I don't think you've done an

episode on relationships

no I did um an episode on attachment

right um but not on relationships the

the series with Conti includes one

episode of the four that's all about

relational understanding and how to

select a mate based on

um matching of drives and all the the

the the the Demons Inside the

subconscious how to match demons and

they dance well together or what and how

generative two people are what does that

mean means that um how the way he

explains it is how devoted to creating

growth within the context of the family

the relationship with work well let me

ask you about mating rituals and uh how

to find such a relationship

I mean you're really big on friendships

on the value of friendships I am

um

and that I think extends itself into a

one of the deepest kinds of friendships

you can have which is a romantic

relationship

what uh What uh uh mistakes

successes and wisdom can you impart well

I've certainly made some mistakes I've

also made some good choices in this

realm

um

first of all we have to Define what sort

of relationship we're talking about if

if one is looking for a life partner you

know potentially somebody to establish

family with with or without kids with or

without pets right families can take

different forms

um I mean I certainly experience being a

family in a prior relationship where it

was the two of us and our two dogs and

it was like it was family like we had

our little family

um

I think

based on my experience and based on

input from friends who themselves have

very successful relationships I must say

I've got friends who

um are in long-term monogamous

very happy

uh relationships where there seems to be

um a lot of love a lot of laughter

a loud Challenge and a lot of growth

and both people

it seems really want to be there and

enjoy being there

it's just a pause on that one thing

to do I think by way of advice is listen

to people who are in long-term

successful relationships that's like uh

it seems dumb but like like we both know

and are friends with Joe Rogan who's

been in a long-term really great

relationship and he's been an

inspiration to me so you take advice

from that guy definitely and several

members of my podcast team are in

excellent relationships I I think

um one of the things that Rings true

over and over again in the advice and in

my experience is

you know find someone who's really a

great friend like build a really great

friendship with that person now

obviously not just a friend if we're

talking romantic relationship but

um and of course sex is super important

but it should be a part of

that particular relationship alongside

or meshed with the Friendship uh

can it be a majority of the the positive

exchange I suppose it could but I think

the Friendship piece is extremely

important because what's required in a

successful relationship clearly is

joy in being together

Trust

a desire to share experience both you

know mundane and and More Adventurous

support each other

acceptance

a real

maybe even admiration but certainly

Delight in being with the person you

know earlier we were talking about peace

and I think that that sense of Peace

comes from knowing that the person

you're in friendship with or that you're

in romantic relationship or ideally both

because let's assume healthy relation

the best romantic relationship includes

a friendship component with that person

it's like you just freely Delight in

their presence even if it's a quiet

presence

um

and you Delight in seeing them Delight

in things right

um that's clear uh the trust piece is

huge

um you know and and that's where people

start I you know we don't want to focus

on what works not what doesn't work but

that's where I think people

start engaging these covert contracts

they're afraid of being betrayed so they

betray

they're afraid of giving up too much

vulnerability so they hide their

vulnerability or in the worst cases they

feign vulnerability

um again that's a covert contract that

just simply undermines everything it

becomes one equals two minus one to

Infinity

conversely I think if people can have

really hard conversations this is

something I've had to work really hard

on in recent years that I'm still

working hard on but the Friendship piece

seems to be the thing that rises to the

top when I talk to friends who are in

these great relationships it's like they

they have so much respect and love and

joy in being with their friend is the

person that they want to spend as much

of their non-working non

uh platonic friendship time with and the

person they want to experience things

with and share things with and

um and it sounds so kind of canned and

cliche nowadays but I think if you step

back and examine how most people go

about finding a relationship so I'm like

oh like am I attracted of course

physical attraction is important in

other forms of Attraction too and they

sort of enter through that portal which

makes sense that's that's the mating

dance right that's the peacock situation

that's hopefully not the Cuttlefish

situation

um but but I think that

um there seems to be

a history of people close to me getting

into great relationships where they were

friends for a while first or maybe

didn't sleep together right away yeah

that they actually intentionally

deferred on that

um this has not been

my habit or my experience you know I've

gone to more

um I think typical like oh there's an

attraction like this person there's an

interest you kind of explore all

dimensions of relationship really

quickly except perhaps the moving in

part and having kids part

um which ideally because it's a bigger

step harder to undo without more severe

consequences

but I think

the whole take it slow thing

um I don't think is about getting to

know someone slowly I think it's about

that physical piece because that does

change the nature of the relationship

and I think it's because it gets right

into the more hardwired primitive

circuitry around our feelings of of

safety vulnerability

um you know there's something about

uh romantic and sexual interactions

where it's almost like

it's like assets and liabilities right

where people are trying to figure out

how much to engage their time and their

energy and multiple people I'm talking

about from both sides you know male

female or whatever it decides but where

it's like assets and liabilities and and

that that's where it starts getting I um

into those

complicated contracts early on I think

and so maybe that's why if a really

great friendship and admiration is is

established first

even if people are romantically and

sexually attracted to one another then

that piece can be added in a little bit

later in a way that

really kind of just seals up the whole

thing and then who knows maybe they

spend 90 of their time having sex I

don't know

um that that's not for me to say or or

decide obviously but there's something

there about

staying out of a certain amount of um

uh risk of having to engage covert

contract in order to protect oneself

but I I do think like

uh

love at first sight this kind of idea is

uh in part realizing very quickly that

you are great friends like I've had that

interesting experience a friendship

recently just it's not really friendship

but like oh you get each other with

humans not I'm not in a romantic setting

right friendship yeah just friendship

dare I say I felt that way about you

when we met right but we also this

dude's cool and he's smart and he's

funny and he's driven and he's giving

and he um and he's got an edge and

um like

I want to want to learn from want to

hang out with them like that I mean that

was the beginning of our friendship was

essentially you know that set of of

internal realization I'm going just keep

going that good keep going shark dresser

yeah yeah it just looks great shirtless

on Horseback yes no no no listen I mean

it's despite what some people might say

on the Internet it's a purely platonic

um friendship somebody said uh somebody

asked if Andrew cooperman has a

girlfriend and somebody says I think so

and the the third comment was this

really like uh breaks my heart like that

uh Alex and Andrew are not a not an item

we are not we are great friends but we

are not an item that's true it's

official the um uh I hear over and over

again from friends that have made great

choices and awesome partners and have

these fantastic relationships for long

periods of time that can seem to

continue to thrive at least that's what

they tell me and that's what I've

observed

establish the Friendship first

and give it a bit of time before

sex and so

you know

I think that's the feeling that's the

feeling and and these are we're talking

micro features and macro features we're

talking you know and this isn't about

perfection it's actually about the

imperfections which is kind of cool I

like quirky people I like characters

I'll tell you where I've gone badly

wrong where I see other people going

badly wrong

if there is no rule that says that you

have to be attracted to all Attractive

people

by any means it's very important to

develop a sense of taste in romantic

attractions I believe what you really

like in terms of a certain style you

know a certain way of being and of

course that includes

um sexuality

um and sex itself the verb but it I

think it also includes there's just

general way of being you know and when

you really adore somebody you like the

way they answer the phone and when they

don't answer the phone that way you know

something's off and you want to know and

so I think that

[Music]

um

the more

you can tune up your powers of

observation not looking for things that

you like

and the more that stuff just kind of

washes over you the more likely you are

to quote unquote fall in love as a

mutual friend of ours uh said to me you

know listen when it comes to romantic

relationships if it's not a hundred

percent in you

it ain't happening and I've never seen

a violation of that statement

where it's like it yeah it's mostly good

and they're this is like the

negotiations well already you're you're

you're it's doomed and that doesn't mean

someone has to be perfect the

relationship has to be perfect but it's

got to feel 100 inside like yes yes and

yes I think diceroth when he was on here

uh your podcast

um mentioned something that you know

like I think the words were you or maybe

it was in his book I don't recall but

that you know love is one of these

things that we story into with somebody

we create this idea of ourselves in the

future and we look at our past

time together and then you story into it

I mean the very few things like that I

can't story into

you know building flying cars I I have

to actually go do something I mean

um

yeah and love is also retroactively

constructed I mean anyone who's gone

through a breakup understands the grief

of knowing ah like this is something I

really shouldn't be in for whatever

reason if because it only takes one if

the other person doesn't want to be it

then you shouldn't be in it but then

missing so many things and that's just

the attachment Machinery really at work

I have to ask you a question that uh

somebody in our amazing team wanted to

ask

he's happily married another like you

mentioned incredible relationship are

they good friends are there Amazing

Friends there you go but okay I'm not

saying who it is so I can say some stuff

which is they it started out as a great

uh sexual connection oh well there you

go but then became very close friends

after that listen there you go uh So

speaking of sex

he was uh he has a wonderful son and

he's wanting to have a second kid and he

wanted to ask the great Andrew huberman

is there uh like sexual positions or any

kind of thing that can help

maximize the chance that they have a

girl versus a boy because they're that

wonderful boy they want a girl is there

is there a way to control the gender

this has been debated for a long time

and I did a uh four and a half hour

episode on fertility and the reason I

did a four and a half hour episode of

fertility is that first of all I find

that the reproductive biology be

fascinating and I wanted a resource for

people that

um were thinking about or struggling

with having kids uh for whatever reason

um and it felt important to me to

combine the male and female components

in the same episode it's all time

stamped so you don't have to listen to

the whole thing I'm gonna talk about IVF

and virtual fertilization we talk about

natural pregnancy okay the data on

position is very interesting but let me

just say a few things there are a few

clinics now in particular some out of

the United States that are spinning down

sperm and finding that they can separate

out fractions as they're called you know

that can spin the sperm down at a given

speed and they'll separate out at

different

um sort of depths within the test tube

that allow them to pull out the sperm on

top or below and bias the probability

towards male or female births it's not

perfect it's not 100 it's a very costly

procedure it's still very controversial

um now with in vitro fertilization it

can extract eggs you can do introduce a

sperm directly by pipette it's a process

called ixy or you can set up a sperm

race in a dish and if you get a number

of different embryos

um meaning the eggs get fertilized to

duplicate and for start to form a

blastocyst which is a ball of cells

early embryo then you can do karyotyping

so you can do look for XX or XY select

the XY which then would give rise to a

male offspring and then plant that one

so there is that kind of sex selection

um

with respect to position there's a lot

of lore that you know if

um the woman is on top or the woman's on

the bottom or whether or not the

penetration is from behind whether or

not it's going to be male or female

Offspring and frankly the data are not

great as you can imagine because those

those would be interesting studies to

run perhaps

um there is studies there is paper there

are some there are they're not I guess

yeah there's more lore than science and

there's a lot of and there are a lot of

other variables that are hard to control

so for instance if it if it's um

ejaculation during intermission during

during sex penetration Etc

um

then you can't measure for instance

sperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF

and they can actually measure how many

milliliters how many forward motile

sperm it's hard to control for for

certain things and um this can vary

between individuals and even from one

ejaculation the next and okay so there's

too many variables however the position

thing is interesting

in the following way

um and then I'll answer whether or not

you can bias towards a female

um as long as we're as long as we're

trying I have other questions about sex

but as long as we're talking about

sexual position all right there are data

that support the idea that in order to

increase the probability of successful

fertilization

that indeed the woman should not stand

upright after sex

and should right after right after the

man is ejaculated inside her and should

adjust her pelvis say 15 degrees upwards

I mean you know

some of the fertility experts MDS will

say that's crazy you know but others

that I

sought out and not specifically for this

answer but for researching that episode

said that yeah you know what you're

talking about is trying to get the

maximum number of sperm and it's

contained in semen and yes the semen can

leak out and so keeping um the pelvis

tilted for about at 15 degrees for about

15 minutes obviously tilted in the

direction that would have things running

Upstream not Downstream so to speak

would gravity it's real

um you know

um so so for maximizing uh fertilization

you know that the doctors I spoke to

just said look given that if people are

trying to get pregnant what is spending

15 minutes on their back

um you know this sort of thing okay so

then with respect to there to female

getting a female Offspring or XX

female Offspring

um

selectively there is the idea that as

fathers get older they're more likely to

have daughters as opposed to Sons that's

a from the papers I've read is a

significant but still mildly significant

result so at with each passing year

um this person increases the probability

they're gonna have a daughter not a son

look um so that's interesting but the

probability differences are probably

tiniest I mean it's it's not you know

it's a signif it's not trivial it's not

a trivial difference

um but if they want to ensure having

a daughter then they should do IVF and

select an xxm um embryo and um when you

go through IVF they genetically screen

them for karyotype which is xxxy

um and they look at mutations genotypic

mutations for things like you know

trisomies and the employees all the

stuff you don't want

but there is a lot of lore if you look

on the internet sure different foods uh

so a lot of variables there's a lot of

area but there haven't been systematic

studies so

um I think probably the best thing to do

unless they're going to do IVF is just

you know roll the dice and um you know

and I think uh with each passing year

they increase the probability of getting

a female Offspring

um and with but of course with each

passing year the egg and sperm quality

degrade so you know get after it soon so

uh I went down a rabbit hole there's

like sexology there's there's journals

oh yeah on sex sure okay so I and some

of them some of them not all quite

reputable

um yeah and some of them really

pioneering in the sense that

um they've taken on topics that are you

know

considered you know outside the main

frame of what people talk about they're

very important

um we have episodes coming out soon with

for instance the head of

um male Urology sexual health and

reproductive Health at Stanford Michael

Eisenberg but also

um you know one with a female urologist

Sexual Health reproductive Health uh Dr

Rena Malik who's on has a quite active

YouTube presence she does these really

um like dry

um present like scientific presentation

but very nice she has a lovely voice and

she but she'll be talking about you know

erections or squirting or like oh is it

like she does like very kind of Internet

type content

um but she's a legitimate urologist

reproductive health expert and in the

podcast we we did talk about

um both male and female orgasm we talked

a lot about sexual function dysfunction

we talked a lot about pelvic floor one

interesting factoid is that

only three only three percent of sexual

dysfunction is

foreign

in nature it's more often related to

some pelvic floor or vasculature blood

flow related or other issue and then

when Eisenberg came on the podcast he

said that far less sexual dysfunction is

psychogenic in origin then people

believe that far more of it is pelvic

floor neuro and Vascular so you know

there's there are the myths of

um I mean it's not saying that it's that

psychogenic dysfunction doesn't exist

but that a lot of the sexual dysfunction

that people assume is related to

hormones or that is related to

psychogenic issues are related to

vascular or neural issues and the good

news is that there are great remedies

for those and um and so those both those

episodes detail some of the

um more Salient points about what those

remedies are and could be I mean one of

the kind of again

factoids but it's interesting that you

know a lot of people have pelvic floor

issues and they think that their pelvic

floors are

um quote unquote messed up so they go on

the internet they learn about kegels

kegels that you know and it turns out

that some people need Giggles they need

to strengthen their pelvic floor guess

what

a huge number of people with sexual and

neurologic

dysfunction

have pelvic floors that are too tight

and kegels are going to make them far

worse and they actually need to learn to

relax their pelvic floor instead of

seeing a pelvic floor specialist is

important I think in the next five ten

years we're going to see a dramatic

shift towards more discussion about

sexual and reproductive Health in a way

that acknowledges that yeah the clitoris

is comes from the same origin tissue as

the the penis and in many ways that the

neural innervation of the two while

clearly different has some overlapping

features that

um you know that there's going to be

discussion around kind of anatomy and

hormones and pelvic floors and

um in a way that's gonna you know um

erode some of the the kind of like

cloaking of these topics because they've

been cloaked for a long time and there's

a lot of like

but let's just call what it is there's a

lot of out there about what's

what

um and now the hormonal issues by the

way just to clarify can impact desire so

a lot of people who have lack of desire

as opposed to lack of anatomical

function this could be male or female

that that can originate with either

things like ssris or hormonal issues and

so we talk about that as well so it's a

pretty vast topic okay you've uh you're

one of the most productive people I know

uh what what's the secret to your

productivity how do you uh maximize the

number of productive hours in a day your

scientist your teacher you're a very

prolific educator

well thanks for the kind words I

struggle like everybody else but I

um I'm pretty

Relentless about

meeting deadlines oh I miss them

sometimes but sometimes that means

cramming sometimes that means starting

early but has that been hard sorry to

interrupt with the podcast you uh

there's certain episodes

I mean you're like taking just

incredibly difficult topics and you know

they're going to be there's going to be

a lot of really good scientists

listening to those with a very skeptical

and careful eye

like how hard do you struggle meeting

that deadline sometimes yeah so we've

pushed out episodes because I want more

time with them I also I haven't

advertised this um but I have another

uh fully tenured professor that's

started um checking my my

um podcasts and helping me

um find papers he's a close friend of

mine he's an incredible expert in

neuroplasticity and that's been helpful

but I research all my all I do all the

primary research for the episodes myself

although my niece has been doing a

summer internship with me and finding

amazing papers she did last summer as

well she's really good at it

um just sick that kid on the internet

and she gets great stuff

um just going on tangents here

what's the hardest finding the papers or

understanding what a paper is saying or

finding finding the best papers yeah

because you have to you know you read a

bunch of reviews figure out who's

getting cited call people in a field

make sure that this is the stuff I mean

you know I did this episode recently on

ketamine about ketamine I wasn't on

ketamine and um and you know there's

this whole debate about s versus arcade

I mean Sr Academy and I called two

clinical experts at Stanford I had a

researcher at UCLA help me even then you

know a few people had gripes about it I

don't think they understood a section

that I was perhaps could have been

clearer about

um but yeah you you're always concerned

that people won't either won't get it or

I won't be clear so that the researching

is mainly about finding the best papers

and then I'm looking for papers that

establish thoroughness of understanding

um that are interesting obviously it's

fun to get occasionally look at some of

the odd or more Progressive papers that

are you know what's new in a field and

then where there are actionable

takeaways to to Really

um export those with with a lot of

thoughtfulness I mean I think that

um going back to the productivity thing

um you know I I do I get up I look at

the sun I I don't stare at the Sun but I

get my sunshine I it all starts with a

really good night's sleep I think that's

really important to understand so much

so that if I wake up and I don't feel

rested enough I'll often do a non-sleep

depressed Yoga Nidra or go back to sleep

for a little bit get up really

prioritize one you know the big block of

work for the thing that I'm researching

I think a little bit of anxiety and a

little bit of concern about deadline

helps

um turning the phone off helps

um

realizing that those peak hours whenever

they are for you you you do not allow

those hours to be invaded unless there's

a you know a nuclear bomb goes off

um and

and nuclear bomb is just a you know a

phraseology for um you know it could be

family crisis would be and you know

would be a good justification if there's

an emergency obviously but

um it's all about Focus it's all about

focus in the moment it's not even so

much about

um how many hours you log it's really

about focusing about how much total

focus can you give to something and then

I like to take walks and think about

things

um and sometimes talk about them in my

voice recorder so I'm just always

churning on it all the time and um

and then of course learning to turn it

off and engage with people socially and

you know not not be podcasting 24 hours

a day in your head is key but I think I

love learning and researching and

finding that those papers and the

information and I love teaching it and

these days I use a whiteboard before I

start I don't have any notes no

teleprompter then the white board that I

use beforehand is to really sculpt out

the different elements and and the flow

get the flow right and move things

around the the Whiteboard is such a

valuable tool then take a couple

pictures of that

when I'm happy with it put it down on

the desk and these are just bullet

points and then just churn through and

just turn through and nothing feels

better than you know researching and

sharing information and and I and as you

did you know grew up writing papers and

it it's hard and I like the friction of

like uh can't you know I want to get up

I want to use the bathroom when I was in

College I was trying to make up

deficiencies from my lack of attendance

in high school

so much so that I I would set a timer I

wouldn't let myself get up to use the

bathroom even never had an accident but

I was you know I mean it's like I

listened to music classical music rancid

a few other things some Bob Dylan maybe

thrown in there

um and just study and just and it felt

and then you know hit the two hour mark

and you're in pain and then you get up

yeah like use the bathroom like that

felt so good there's something about the

human brain that likes these kind of

friction points and working through them

and you just have to work through them

so yeah I'm productive and and my life

has arranged around it and you know

that's been a bit of a barrier to

personal life at times but my life's

been arranged around it I've set up

everything so that I can learn more

teach more

um including

you know some of my home life and

um but I do you know still watch chimp

Empire still got time to watch Jim Bob

look the great Joe Strummer

all right Clash or my favorite

mescaleros he said you know this famous

drummer quote no input no output

so you need you need experience you need

outside things in order to Foster the

the process but

uh yeah just nose to the grindstone man

I don't know I don't I don't know and

that's what and that's what I'm happy to

do with my life I don't think anyone

should do that just because but this is

how I'm showing up and you know if you

don't like me then Scrolls whether they

say swipe left so whatever I I don't

know I'm not on the apps the dating apps

so that's the other thing I keep waiting

for when um

listens to like Freeman podcast is a

check box on like hinge or Bumble or

whatever it is but I don't even know are

those that are field is I don't know

what the what are the apps now I've

never used an app and I I I those

file Troublesome how little information

is provided on apps well they're the

ones that are like a stocked Lake like

like Raya you know it's like that they

like they sort of like companies will

actually fill them with people that look

a certain way and well soon it'll be

filled with AI oh yeah that's the way

you said oh yeah that's a hard break

within that well I you know I'm guilty

of liking real human interaction

that have you tried AI interaction

no but I have a feeling you're gonna

convince me to

one day

um yeah I've I've also struggled

finishing projects that are new there

are some something new

like for example some one of the things

that really struggled finishing is

something that's in Russian that

requires translation and overdub and all

that kind of stuff the other project

I've been working on for like over

at least a year

and off and on but trying to finish is

something we've talked about in the past

is I'm still on it uh project on Hitler

in World War II I've written so much

about it and I just don't know why I

can't finish it I have trouble like

really

um

I think I'm terrified being in front of

the camera

like this like this or so well actually

no no no solo well if you want to do

solo and seriously because we've done

this before right our our clandestine uh

study missions I'll I'm happy to sit in

the corner and work on my book or do

something if you want to if it feels

good it's just just for the feeling of

somebody else definitely what do you I

mean how do you you don't seem to

you seem to have been Fearless to just

sit in front of the camera

by yourself to do the episode yeah it

was weird I mean the first year of the

podcast it just spilled out of me it was

just I had all that stuff I was so

excited about I've been talking to

everyone and who would listen and anyone

uh anyone who they run away I'd keep

talking you know before there was ever a

camera wasn't on social media in 2019 I

posted a little bit 2020 as you know I

started going on podcast but yeah I had

so I just

I just

the zest and Delight in this stuff it's

like circadian rhythms I'm going to tell

you about this stuff I just felt like

here's the opportunity and just let it

burst and then as we've gotten into

topics that are a little bit further

away from my my um home knowledge you

know it the it's like

I still get super excited about it it's

music in the Brain Episode I've been

researching for a while and I'm just so

hyped like about it it's so so

interesting there's so many facets

singing versus improvation

improvisational excuse me music versus

I'm listening to music versus

um learning music I mean it just goes on

and on there's just so much that's so

interesting I just can't get enough and

and I think

oh you put a camera in front of me I

sort of forget about it uh and I'm just

trying to just teach yes that's the

difference that's interesting I mean I

forget the camera maybe I need to find

that joy as well but like for me a lot

of the joys in the in the writing and uh

the the camera there's something well

the best lecturers as you know and

you're in a phenomenal lecturer so you

embody this as well but the when I teach

at Stanford I was directing this course

in neuroanatomy and Neuroscience and for

medical students and I noticed that the

best lecturers would come in and they're

teaching the material from a place of

deep understanding but they're also

experiencing it as a first-time learner

as at the same time so it's just sort of

embodying the Delight of it but also the

authority over them not Authority but

the the sort of Mastery of the material

and it's really the Delight in it that

the students are linking on to and of

course they need and deserve the best

accurate material so they have to know

what they're talking about but

um yeah just tap into that energy of

learning and loving it and people were

along for the ride or you know I get

accused of being long-winded but you

know things get taken out of context

that leads to Greater misunderstanding

and also I look at listen I come from a

lineage of three debt advisors three all

three

so I don't know when the reaper is

coming for me I'm doing my best to stay

alive a long time but whether or not

it's a bullet or a bus or

cancer or whatever or just old age I

mean I'm trying to get it all out there

as best I can and if it means you have

to hit pause and come back a day or two

later like that seems like a reasonable

compromise to me I'm not gonna go

um go longer than I need to and I'm

trying to shorten them up but uh again

that's just kind of how I show up it's

like Tim Armstrong would say about

writing songs I asked him do you write

how often you write every day

every day was Rick ever stop creating no

is Joe ever stop preparing for comedy

are you ever stopping to think about

world issues and and technology and who

you can talk to I mean it seems to me

you've always got a plan

the inside the the thing I love about

your podcast the most

to be honest these days is the surprise

of like I don't know who the hell is

going to be there it's almost like like

I get a little nervously excited about

when a new episode comes out because I

have no idea no idea and you know I mean

I have some guesses based on what you

told me during the break I mean yeah

you've got someone people where it's

just like whoa Lexus went there awesome

can't wait click you know there you know

I think that's really cool like you're

constantly surprising people so you're

doing it so well like it's such a high

level and I think it's also important

for people to understand that what

you're doing relax

there's no precedent for it sure there

have been interviews before there have

been podcasts before their discussions

before but it's not like how many of

your peers can you look to to find out

how best to do the content like yours

zero there's one peer you

and so you know that should give you

great peace and great excitement because

you're you're a Pioneer you're the

you're literally the tip of the spear I

I don't want to take an unnecessary

tangent but I think this might thread

together two of the things that we've

been talking about which are I think of

pretty key importance one is romantic

relationships and the other is creative

process and work and this again is

something I learned from Rick but that

he and I have gone back and forth on and

that

um I think is worth elaborating on which

is

earlier we're saying you know the best

relationship is going to be one where

you where it brings you peace I think

peace also can be translated to among

other things

lack of distraction so when you're with

your partner can you really focus on

them and the relationship

can you not be distracted by

things that you're upset about from

their past or from your past with them

or their and of course the same is true

for them right they ideally will feel

that way towards you too they can really

focus also

when you're not with them can you focus

on your work can you not be worried

about whether or not they're okay

because you trust that they're an adult

and they can handle things or they will

reach out if they need things

um they're going to communicate their

needs like an adult you know not

creating message just to get attention

and things like that or

or disappearing you know for that matter

so

peace and focus are intimately related

and distraction is the enemy of peace

and focus

so there's something there I believe

um because with people that have a

strong generative drive and want to you

know be productive in their home life in

the sense have a rich family life

um or partner life whatever that is and

in their work life

you know the ability to really drop into

the work and

like okay you might have that sense like

I hope they're okay or you know need to

check my phone or something but just

know like we're good yeah so so peace

and focus I think and present being

present are so key and it's key at every

level of romantic relationship from

um you know certainly presence and focus

you know everything from sex to

listening to

um to you know raising a family to

tending to the house

um and in work it's absolutely critical

so I think that those things are kind of

mirror images of the same thing and

they're both important reflections of

the other and when you start to just you

know when work is not going well then

the relationship the focus on

relationship can suffer and vice versa

so and it's crazy how important that is

oh

how incredibly

um uh wonderful it could be to have a

person in your life that kind of uh

enables that creative Focus yeah and you

supply the the peace and focus for their

Endeavors whatever those might be I mean

that that symmetry there

um because clearly people have different

needs and the need to just really trust

you know like when Lex is working he's

in his generative mode and and and I

know he's good and so then they they

feel sure they've contributed to that

but then also what you're doing is

supporting them in whatever way it

happens to be and I think that sometimes

you'll see that people will pair up

along creative creative or Musical

musical or

um computer scientists but I think again

going back to this Conti episode on on

relationships is that the superficial

labels are less important it seems than

just the desire to create that kind of

home life in a relationship together and

as a consequence the the work mode and

for some people there both people aren't

working and sometimes they are but I

think that's I think that's the good

stuff you know and and I think that's

the big learning in all of it is that

the further along I go with each

birthday I guarantee you're gonna be

like what I want is simpler and simpler

and harder and harder to to uh create

but oh so worth it

the inner and the outer piece it's uh

been over two years I think

uh since Costello passed away

it still tears me up uh I cried about

him today I cried about him today huh

it's it's it's it's proportional to the

love

but yeah I'll cry about it right now if

I think but it wasn't putting him down

it wasn't the act of him dying any of

that actually that was a beautiful

experience

um I didn't expect it to be but it was

in my place when I was living in Topanga

during the pandemic where we launched

the podcast and I did it at home

and he hated the Vats I did at home and

it was he gave out this huge

right at the end and I could just tell

he had been in just not a lot of pain

fortunately but he had just been working

so hard just to move at all and the

craziest thing happened like it was

unbelief I've never had an experience

like this I expected my heart to break

and I felt a broken heart before I felt

it frankly one of my parents split I

felt it when Harry shot himself I heard

I felt it when Barbara died I even felt

it when you know when Ben went

um so as well and so many friends like

way too many friends I mean the end of

2017 my friend Aaron King

John Johnny Farrer John eichelberry

stomach cancer suicide fentanyl it's

like whoa all in a freaking week and I

just remember thinking like what the but

when cust like and it's just

heartbreaking you just carry that and

it's like uh but and that's just a short

list you know and I don't say that for

SOB stories just for a guy that wasn't

in the military or didn't grow up in the

inner city like it's an unusual number

of like deaths like close people

um

when Costello went the craziest thing

happened my heart warmed up it like

heated up and I wasn't on MDMA and I

wasn't I I was just it just the moment

he went he just went

and I was like what the hell is this and

it was just it was like a supernatural

experience to me I just never had that

I'd put my grandfather on the ground I

was a pallbearer at the funeral I've

like done that more times than I'd like

to

to have ever done it and

you just heat it up with costume I

thought what the is this and it was

almost like and you can make up these we

make up these stories about what it is

but it was almost like he was like all

right I have to be careful because I

will cry here

um and I don't want to

um

it was almost like he was like

all that effort because I've been

putting so much effort into him it was

like all right you get that back it was

like the giant freaking thank you and it

was it was incredible you know and I'm

not embarrassed to shed a tear or two

about it if I have to like I was like

holy like that's how close I was to

that animal where do you think where do

you think you can find that kind of love

again man I don't know I mean when um

excuse me for for welling up but it was

just I mean it's a freaking dog right I

get it but for me it was

um the first real home I ever had

um but when Costello went

it was like we'd have this home in

Topanga we'd set it up and we're like

and he was just so happy there and I

think it just um

I don't know it was it was like this

weird like Victory slash massive loss

like like we didn't 11 years

freaking did everything everything to

make him as comfortable as possible and

he was super loyal beautiful animal but

also just

funny and fun and and I was like I did

it like like you know I gave as much of

myself to this being as a human I felt I

could without making it you know like

you know detract detracting from the

rest of my life and he Lo and so I don't

know

um when I think about Barbara especially

um I well up and I and it's hard for me

but I mean I talked to her before she

died and that was a brutal conversation

saying goodbye to someone

especially with kids and

um that was hard

um I think that really

um flipped a switch in me where I'm like

I I always knew I wanted kids I say I

want kids I want a lot of kids that flip

to switching me I was like I want kids I

want my own kids you might be able to

find that kind of love yeah I I think

because it was the caretaking it wasn't

about what he gave me all that time and

the more I could take care of him and

see him happy the better I felt it was

crazy and I I'm I don't know so

the miss them every day every day every

day you're uh you got a heart that's so

full of love I can't wait uh for you to

have kids uh for you to be a father yeah

I can't wait I'm ready for it when uh

you know uh when when God decides I'm

ready I'll I'll have them

and then I will still beat you to it as

I told you many times before I think you

should

um absolutely have kids I mean look at

the people in our life because because

we're kind of the if you in case you

haven't realized it already like we're

the the younger of the podcasters but

you know like Joe and Peter and

Segura and you know I'm you know and the

rest right there they're the like the

they're like the tribal Elders right and

um and we're you know we're not the the

youngest in the crew but we're we're if

you look at all those guys

they all have kids

they all adore their kids and their kids

bring tremendous meaning to their life

like we we'd be morons if

you know if you didn't go off and start

a family I didn't start off yeah to

start a family

um and yeah I think that's that's the

goal I mean I think the kids of the

goals that's one of them the kids not

only make them uh their life more joyful

and brings love to their life it's also

makes them more productive makes them

better people all that it's like oh it's

it's it's uh it's kind of obvious yeah I

think that's what Costello wanted I

think I have this story in my head that

he was just like okay like take this I

can yeah and don't forget
