of\n\nsorts Andrew flew down to Austin just to\n\nwish me happy birthday and we decided to\n\ndo a podcast last second we literally\n\ntalked for hours beforehand in a long\n\ntime after late into the night he's one\n\nof my favorite human beings brilliant\n\nscientists incredible teacher and a\n\nloyal friend I'm grateful for Andrew I'm\n\ngrateful for good friends for all the\n\nsupport and love I've gotten over the\n\npast few years\n\nI'm truly grateful for this life for the\n\nyears the days the minutes the seconds\n\nI've gotten to live on this beautiful\n\nEarth of ours I really don't want to\n\nleave just yet\n\nI think I'd really like to stick around\n\nI love you all\n\nthis is the last treatment podcast and\n\nnow dear friends here's Andrew\n\nhuberman\n\ntrying to uh\n\nrun a little bit more are you losing\n\nweight I'm not trying to lose weight but\n\nI always do the same Fitness routine\n\nafter like 30 years basically uh lift\n\nthree days a week run three days a week\n\num but one of the runs is the long run\n\none of them's medium one of them's a\n\nSprint type thing so\n\num what I've decided to do this year was\n\njust extend the duration of the long run\n\nand\n\num I like being a mobile I I never want\n\nto be\n\num so heavy that I can't move like like\n\nI want to be able to go out and run 10\n\nmiles if I have to so sometimes I do\n\num and I want to be able to Sprint if I\n\nhave to so sometimes I do and um lifting\n\nin objects is feels good it feels good\n\nto train like a lazy bear and just lift\n\nheavy objects but I've also started\n\ntraining with lighter weights and higher\n\nrepetitions and\n\num for three month cycles and it gives\n\nyour joints a rest and um yeah so\n\nprobably you know it I think it also is\n\ninteresting to see how training\n\ndifferently changes your cognition\n\nthat's probably hormone related you know\n\nhormones Downstream of training heavy\n\nversus hormones Downstream of training a\n\nlittle bit lighter\n\num I think my cognition is better when\n\nI'm doing more cardio and when the\n\nrepetition ranges are a little bit\n\nhigher which is not to say that people\n\nwho lift heavy are dumb but there is a\n\nbecause there's real value in lifting\n\nheavy there's a lot of angry people\n\nlistening to this right now no no no but\n\nlifting heavy and then taking three to\n\nfive minutes rest is Far and Away a\n\ndifferent\n\nchallenge than running hard for 90\n\nminutes\n\nthat's a tough thing just like getting\n\nin an ice bath people say oh well how is\n\nthat any different than working out\n\num well there are a lot of differences\n\nbut one of them is that it's very acute\n\nstress within one second you're stressed\n\nso I I think subjecting the body to a\n\nbunch of different types of stressors in\n\nspace and time is really valuable so\n\nyeah I've been playing with the\n\nvariables in a pretty systematic way\n\nwell I like long and slow\n\nfor like you said the impact it has on\n\nmy cognition yeah it it uh the\n\nwordlessness of it\n\num the way it puts you in in a the way\n\nit seems to\n\num clean out the Clutter yeah you know\n\num it can take away that hyper focus and\n\nput you more in a relaxed\n\nFocus for sure well for me it brings the\n\nClutter to the surface at first like all\n\nthese thoughts come in there and then\n\nthey

working through this anyway but\n\nwalking doesn't hurt so I've been\n\nplaying around with walking recently\n\nlike for two hours and thinking because\n\nI know a lot of like\n\nsmart people throughout history have\n\nwalked and thought you have to like you\n\nknow play with things that have worked\n\nfor others not just to exercise but to\n\nlike integrate this very light kind of\n\nprolonged exercise into a productive\n\nlife so they do all their thinking while\n\nthey walk it's like a meditative type of\n\nwalking it's it's really interesting it\n\nreally works yeah the um the practice\n\nI've been doing a lot more of lately as\n\nI walk while reading a book in the yard\n\nI'll just Pace back and forth or walk in\n\na circle audiobook are you talking no\n\nhard copy where you just holding I\n\nholding the book and I'm walking and I'm\n\nreading yeah and I usually have a pen\n\nand I'm underlining I have this whole\n\nsystem like underlining Stars\n\nexclamation points goes back to\n\nUniversity of what things I'll go back\n\nto\n\num which things I export to notes and\n\nthat kind of thing\n\num but from the beginning when I opened\n\nmy lab at that time in San Diego before\n\nI moved back to Stanford\n\num I would have meetings with my\n\nstudents or postdocs by just walking in\n\nthe field behind the lab\n\num you know and I'd bring my Bulldog\n\nCostello yeah Bulldog Mastiff at the\n\ntime and he was a slow Walker so these\n\nwere slow walks but I can think much\n\nmore clearly that way there's a Nobel\n\nprize-winning uh professor at Columbia\n\nUniversity School of Medicine Richard\n\nAxel who won the Nobel Prize co1 Nobel\n\nPrize with Linda Buck for the discovery\n\nof the molecular basis of olfaction and\n\num he walks in voice dictates his papers\n\nand now with rev or these other maybe\n\nthere are better ones um than rev where\n\nyou can convert audio files into text\n\nvery quickly and then edit from there so\n\nI I will often voice dictate\n\num first drafts and things like that and\n\num I totally agree on the long runs the\n\nwalks the integrating that with\n\ncognitive work harder to do with Sprints\n\num

know and then when you look\n\naround you see tremendous variation you\n\nknow some people have like the the\n\num wrist uh width of a whippet or Woody\n\nAllen and then other people like you or\n\nJocko or you know there's this one uh\n\nJocko video or thing on GQ or something\n\nHave you seen the comments on Jocko\n\nthese are the best\n\num the comments I love the comments on\n\nYouTube because occasionally they're\n\nfunny\n\num the best is uh when shock was born\n\nthe doctor looked at his uh parents and\n\nsaid it's a man\n\nit's like Chuck Norris type comments\n\nyeah yeah those

second third and fourth and\n\nfifth time\n\num it turned out the exact same way in\n\nother words\n\num there have been a few times in my\n\nlife where\n\nI did not feel\n\neasy about something I did I felt\n\na signal for my body this is not good\n\num and I didn't trust it early on but I\n\nknew it was there\n\nand then\n\ntwo or three\n\nbad experiences later\n\nI'm able to say ah every single time\n\nthere was a signal from the body\n\ninforming my mind\n\nthis is not good\n\nnow the reverse has also been true that\n\nthere have been a number of instances in\n\nwhich I feel sort of immediate delight\n\nand there's this kind of almost\n\nastonishingly\n\nsimple experience of feeling comfortable\n\nwith somebody or at peace with something\n\nor delighted at an experience and

you\n\nknow\n\num I trim respect tremendously I think\n\nhe's one of the smartest people I've\n\never met\n\num I think for different reasons he and\n\nMark Andreessen are some of the like\n\nsmartest people I've ever met but Paul's\n\nlevel of insight into the human psyche\n\nis is absolutely astounding and um and\n\num he\n\nsays the opposite of what most\n\npeople say about the brain which is most\n\npeople say oh the supercomputer of the\n\nbrain is the forebrain it's like a\n\nmonkey brain with a extra real estate\n\nput on there and the forebrain is what\n\nmakes us human\n\num and

he'll\n\nelaborate wait you're doing a thing with\n\nfall we already did yeah so Paul oh nice\n\nyeah so Paul Conte shot up uh we did it\n\nhe and I sat down he did a four episode\n\nseries on Mental Health this is not\n\nmental illness mental health about how\n\nto explore one's own subconscious\n\nexplore the self build and cultivate\n\num the generative Drive you'll learn\n\nmore about what that is from him he's\n\nfar more eloquent um and and clearer\n\nthan I am\n\num and he provides essentially a a set\n\nof steps to explore the self that does\n\nnot require that you work with a\n\ntherapist this is self-exploration that\n\nthat is rooted in\n\nPsychiatry it's rooted in neuroscience\n\nand I don't think this information\n\nexists anywhere else I'm not aware that\n\nit exists anywhere else and um he\n\nessentially distills it all down to one\n\nuh eight and a half by eleven sheet\n\nwhich we provide for people and\n\num\n\nhe says there I don't want to give too\n\nmuch away because it I would detract\n\nfrom what he does so beautifully but if\n\nI tried and I want to accomplish it\n\nanyway\n\num but he said and I believe that the\n\nsubconscious is the super computer of\n\nthe brain all the stuff working\n\nunderneath our conscious awareness\n\nthat's driving our feelings and our what\n\nwe think are the decisions that we've\n\nthought through so carefully and that\n\nonly by exploring the subconscious and\n\nunderstanding it a little bit\n\num can we actually uh\n\nimprove ourselves over time and I agree\n\nI think that so that the mistake is to\n\nthink that thinking can override at all\n\nit's a certain style of introspection\n\nand thinking that um allows us to read\n\nthe signals from our body read the\n\nsignals from our brain integrate the the\n\nknowledge that we're collecting about\n\nourselves and and to use all that in\n\nways that are really adaptive and\n\ngenerative for us what do you think is\n\nthere in that subconscious well what do\n\nyou think of the younging as Shadow is\n\nwhat what's there you know there's this\n\nidea you're familiar with too I'm sure\n\nthat this jungian idea that there we all\n\nhave all things inside of us that all of\n\nus have the capacity to be evil to be\n\ngood Etc but that some people Express\n\none or the other to a greater extent but\n\nhe also mentioned that there's a unique\n\ncategory of people maybe two to five\n\npercent of people that don't just have\n\nall things inside of them but they\n\nactually spend a lot of time exploring a\n\nlot of those things the darker recesses\n\nthe Shadows their own Shadows\n\num\n\nyou know I'm somebody who's drawn to\n\ngoodness and to light into joy and all\n\nthose things like anybody else but

not\n\nacknowledge their presence and have them\n\nsurface in the form of addictions or\n\nbehaviors that um that damage Us in\n\nother people so one of the processes for\n\nachieving mental health is to bring\n\nthose things to the surface so fish the\n\nsubconscious mind yes and um and you\n\nknow he Paul describes 10 cupboards that\n\none can look into for exploring the self\n\nthere's the structure of self and the\n\nfunction of self again this will all be\n\nspelled out in the series in a lot of\n\ndetail also in terms of its relational\n\naspect between people how to pick good\n\npartners and good relationship gets\n\nreally into this from a very different\n\nperspective\n\num yeah fascinating stuff I was just\n\nsitting there just I will say this that\n\nthat four episode series with Paul\n\nis at least to date the most important\n\nwork I've ever been involved in\n\nin all of my career because it's very\n\nclear that we are not taught how to\n\nexplore our subconscious yeah and that\n\nvery few people actually understand how\n\nto do that even most psychiatrists he\n\nhas a uh he mentioned something about\n\npsychiatrists you know if you're a\n\ncardiothoracic surgeon or something like\n\nthat and 50 of your patients die you're\n\nconsidered a bad cardiothoracic surgeon\n\nbut with no disrespect to psychiatrists\n\nthere are there are some excellent\n\npsychiatrists out there they're also a\n\nlot of terrible psychiatrists out there\n\nbecause unless all of those all of their\n\npatients commit suicide or half commit\n\nsuicide they can treat for a long time\n\nwithout it becoming visible that they're\n\nnot so good at their craft now he's\n\nsuperb at his craft and\n\num I think he would say that yes\n\nexploring some Shadows but also just\n\nunderstanding the self like what what\n\nyou know really under understanding like\n\nlike who am I and and what's important\n\nwhat are my ambitions what are my\n\nstriving again I'm lifting from some of\n\nthe things that that he'll describe\n\nexactly how to do this\n\npeople do not spend enough time\n\naddressing those questions and as a\n\nconsequence they discover what resides\n\nin their subconscious through the\n\nsometimes bad hopefully all also good\n\nbut um manifestations of their actions\n\nthey're we are driven by this huge\n\nninety percent of our real estate that\n\nis not visible to our conscious\n\nawareness and we we need to understand\n\nthat you know I've talked about this\n\nbefore I've done therapy twice a week\n\nsince I was a kid I had to as a\n\ncondition of being let back in school\n\num I continue I found a way to either\n\nthrough insurance or even when I didn't\n\nhave insurance I took an extra job\n\nwriting for Thrasher magazine when I was\n\na postdoc so I could pay for therapy at\n\na discount because I didn't make much\n\nmoney as a postdoc I mean I think for me\n\nit's as important as going to the gym\n\nand people think it's just you know\n\nruminating on problems or getting\n\nsomewhere no no if you work with\n\nsomebody really good they're forcing you\n\nto ask questions about who you", "start_char_idx": null,

is this a\n\nis this who you are fundamentally\n\nand it will always be this way or is\n\nthis a problem to be fixed like for\n\nexample one of the things\n\nespecially recently but in general over\n\ntime I've discovered about myself\n\nprobably has roots in childhood probably\n\nhas roots and a lot of things as I\n\ndeeply value loyalty\n\nmaybe more than the average person and\n\nso when there's disloyalty it can be\n\npainful to me and so this is who I am\n\nand so do I have to\n\nrelax a bit\n\ndo I have to fix this part or is this\n\nwho you are and there's a million that's\n\none like little I think loyalty is a\n\ngood thing to cling to provided that\n\nwhen loyalty is broken that it doesn't\n\num disrupt too many other areas of your\n\nlife but it depends also on who's\n\ndisrupting that loyalty if it's a\n\nco-worker versus a romantic partner\n\nversus your exclusive romantic partner\n\ndepending on the structure of your\n\nromantic partner life you know I mean I\n\nhave always experienced extreme\n\num\n\njoy and feelings of safety and Trust in\n\nmy friendships again mostly male\n\nfriendships what female friendships do\n\nwhich is only to say that they were\n\nmostly male friendships the female\n\nfriendships have also been very loyal\n\num let you know so getting backstabbed\n\nis not something I'm familiar with\n\num and yeah I love being crewed up you\n\nknow yeah no for sure and I'm with you\n\nand you know you and I are very much\n\nhave the same values on this but you\n\nknow that's one little thing and then\n\nthere's many other things like I'm\n\nextremely self-critical and you look at\n\nmy you know I look at myself as I'm\n\nregularly very self-critical there's a\n\nself-critical engine in my brain and I\n\ntalked to actually Paul about this I\n\nthink on the podcast quite a bit and\n\nhe's saying this is a really bad thing\n\nlike you need to fix this you need to be\n\nable to be regularly very uh positive\n\nabout yourself and I kept disagreeing\n\nwith them no this is like who I am like\n\nyou and it seems to work don't mess with\n\nthe thing that seems to be working it's\n\nfine like I oscillate between being\n\nreally grateful and really self-critical\n\nbut then you have to like figure out\n\nwhat is it maybe is there's a deeper\n\nroot thing there's maybe there's an\n\ninsecurity in there somewhere that has\n\nto do with childhood and are you trying\n\nto prove something to somebody from your\n\nchildhood this kind of thing well a\n\ncouple things that I think are\n\nhopefully

others and\n\nhopefully but sometimes on our own as\n\nwell I don't think we can rewire our\n\ndeep preferences and what we find\n\nDespicable or joyful\n\nI do think that\n\nit's really a question of

to be neurotic to actually\n\nsee one's own issues and work with them\n\nwhereas psychotic is the other is the\n\nother way to be uh which is obviously\n\nnot good so I think um the

other people too he's not\n\ndoesn't advertise that much because he's\n\nhumble but I end up by the way I went to\n\na show of theirs like 20 years ago yeah\n\nI'm going to see them in Boston in\n\nSeptember 18th I'm literally flying\n\nthere for for\n\num uh or I'll take the train up from New\n\nYork I'm gonna meet a friend of mine\n\nnamed Jim thibo who's a big guy who owns\n\na lot of

you said I\n\nthink there's a there's a Psalm the\n\nfirst song on the Indestructible album I\n\nthink it there's a\n\num it's sort of he's just talking about\n\nlike shock and disbelief of discovering\n\nthings about people that were close to\n\nyou and you know it's\n\num I won't I won't sing it but you know\n\nnor I wouldn't dare but um but there's\n\nthis one lyric where that's really stuck\n\nin my mind for for ever since that album\n\ncame out in 2003 which is\n\num you know\n\nthat nothing's what it seems so I just\n\nsit here laughing I'm gonna keep going\n\non I can't get distracted there is this\n\npiece of like you got to learn how to\n\npush out the disturbing stuff sometimes\n\nand go forward and I mean I remember\n\nhearing that lyric and and then writing\n\nit down and you know that was a time\n\nwhere my undergraduate advisor who was\n\nlike a a mentor and a father to me you\n\nknow blew his head off in the bathtub\n\nlike three weeks before and then my\n\ngraduate advisor who I was working for\n\nat that time who I loved and adored was\n\nreally like a mother to me I knew her\n\nwhen she was pregnant with her two kids\n\ndied at 50. breast cancer and then my\n\npostdoc advisor you know first day of\n\nwork at Stanford as a faculty member\n\nsitting across the table like this from\n\nhim had a heart attack right in front of\n\nme died of pancreatic cancer at the end\n\nof 2017.

thinking\n\nlike we're seeing something or learning\n\nsomething about something you just like\n\nyou can't believe it and I I I mentioned\n\nthat that lyric off that first song\n\nIndestructible on that album because\n\nit's this the emo like just the raw\n\nemotion of like I can't believe this\n\nwhat I just saw is so disturbing\n\nbut I have to just keep going forward\n\nthere are certain things that we really\n\ndo need to push not just into our\n\nperiphery but often to The Gutter and\n\nkeep going and that's a hard thing to\n\nlearn how to do but\n\nif you're going to be functional in life\n\nyou have to and actually just to get at\n\nthis issue of do I change or do I\n\nembrace this aspect of self\n\num about six months it was April\n\num\n\nof this last year I did some

get peace through this I was\n\nlike I'm gonna let go of that and I\n\nspent 11 hours just getting more and\n\nmore frustrated and angry about this\n\nthing that I was trying to resolve and I\n\nwas so unbelievably disappointed that I\n\ncouldn't get that relief and I was like\n\nwhat is this like this is not how this\n\nis supposed to work\n\nI'm supposed to be feel peace the clouds\n\nare supposed to lift and so a week went\n\nby\n\nand then another half week went by and\n\nthen someone who I whose opinion I trust\n\nvery much I explained this to them\n\nbecause I was getting a little concerned\n\nlike what's going on this is worse not\n\nbetter and they said this is very simple\n\nyou have a giant blind spot\n\nwhich is your sense of justice Andrew\n\nand your sense of anger are linked like\n\nan iron rod\n\nand you need to relax it\n\nand as they said that I felt the anger\n\ndissipate and so there was something\n\nthat I think is it is true I have a very\n\nstrong sense of justice and my sense of\n\nanger\n\nthen at least uh was very strongly\n\nlinked to it so it's great to have a\n\nsense of justice right I hate to see\n\npeople wrong I absolutely do and I'm\n\nhuman I'm sure I've wronged people in my\n\nlife I know I have they've told me I've\n\ntried to apologize and reconcile where\n\npossible still have a lot of work to do\n\num but\n\nwhere I see Injustice it draws in my\n\nsense of anger in a way that I think is\n\njust eating me up and but it was only in\n\nhearing that link that I wasn't aware of\n\nbefore it was in my subconscious\n\nobviously\n\num did I feel the relaxation it wasn't\n\nthere's no amount of plant medicine or\n\nMDMA or any kind of you know chemical\n\nyou can take that's naturally just going\n\nto dissipate what's hard for oneself it\n\nneeds if one Embraces that or if one\n\nchooses to do it through just talk\n\ntherapy or journaling or friends or\n\nintrospection or all of the above there\n\nneeds to be an awareness of the things\n\nthat we're just not aware of so I think\n\nthe answer to your question do you\n\nEmbrace or do you fight these aspects of\n\nself is\n\num I think you get in your subconscious\n\nthrough good work with somebody skilled\n\nor and sometimes that involves the tools\n\nI just mentioned in various combinations\n\nand you figure it out you figure out if\n\nit's serving you obviously it was not\n\nbringing me peace it was undermining my\n\nmy sense of justice was undermining my\n\nsense of peace and so in understanding\n\nthis link be now I would say that the in\n\nunderstanding this link between Justice\n\nand anger now I think it's a little bit\n\nmore of like uh\n\nyou know it's not like a Twizzler stick\n\nbendy but it's at least it's not like an\n\niron Rod like you know when I see\n\nsomebody wronged I mean it used to just\n\nlike like immediately but you're able to\n\nstep back now that's like to me the\n\nultimate place to reach\n\nis

the problem I\n\nthink in just laughing at something like\n\nthat gives you distance\n\nbut the question is\n\ndoes do you stop engaging with it at\n\nthat point like I experienced this I\n\nmean recently I got to see how sometimes\n\nI'll see something that's just like what\n\nlike this is crazy so I just laugh but\n\nthen I continue to engage in it and it's\n\ntaking me off of course and so there is\n\na place where you know I mean I get\n\nrealize this is probably a kids show too\n\nso I want to keep it you know G-rated\n\nbut it at some point for certain things\n\nit makes sense to go\n\n that but also laugh at yourself for\n\nsaying that yeah and then move on\n\nso the question is are you you get stuck\n\nor do you move on sure right sure but\n\nlike there's a lightness of

it should be a human lab episode on\n\nthis it's a cologne that's burnt hair\n\nand it's like supposedly a really\n\nintense smell and it is to please it's\n\nnot gonna leave you or no that's okay\n\nwell that's okay I'll take a whiff it as\n\nif you have a chemical spray it on\n\nyourself because I don't know if you can\n\nso I'm reading an amazing book yeah\n\ncalled an immense World by Ed young he\n\nwon a Pulitzer for uh we contain\n\nmultitudes or something like that I\n\nthink it's the title of the other book\n\num and the first chapter is all battle\n\nfaction and the incredible power that\n\nolfaction has\n\nthat smells terrible I mean it doesn't\n\nleave you ah for those listening it\n\ndoesn't quite smell terrible it's just\n\nintense and it stays with you\n\nthis this to me represents like just\n\nlaughing at the absurdity of it all so I\n\nhave to ask so you were rolling Jiu\n\nJitsu yeah so is that fight between\n\num Elon and and azak actually going to\n\nhappen I think Elon is a huge believer\n\nof this idea of uh the most entertaining\n\noutcome is the most likely\n\nand he almost like there's\n\nalmost the sense that there's not a free\n\nwill and the universe has a kind of\n\ndeterministic\n\ngravitational field pulling towards the\n\nmost fun\n\nand he's just a player in that game so\n\nfrom that perspective I think it seems\n\nlike something like that is inevitable\n\nlike like a little scrap in the parking\n\nlot of Facebook or something like\n\nexactly sorry meta yeah but it looks\n\nlike they're they're training for real\n\nand Zuck has competed right Jiu Jitsu so\n\num I think he is approaching it as a\n\nsport yeah Elon is approaching it as a\n\nspectacle and I mean the way he talks\n\nabout it he's a huge fan of History he\n\ntalks about all the Warriors that have\n\nfought throughout history if you look he\n\nwants to really do it at the Coliseum\n\nand you know the Coliseum is for 400\n\nyears I was there's so many so much\n\ngreat writing about this\n\num I think over 400 000 people have died\n\nin the Coliseum Gladiators so this is\n\nthis historic place that sheds so much\n\nblood so much fear so much anticipation\n\nof battle all of this so he loves this\n\nkind of spectacle and also the uh the\n\nmeme of it a hilarious absurdity of it\n\nthe two Tech CEOs are battling it out on\n\nsand in a place

I\n\ndefinitely got hit back\n\num I'd Spar on Wednesday nights when I\n\nlived on San Diego\n\num and\n\num you know when you spar with somebody\n\neven if they hurt you especially if they\n\nhurt you you know you see that person\n\nafterwards and there's there's an\n\nintimacy right you're it was it was in\n\nthat book Fire's heart where he explains\n\nyou know you're exchanging bodily fluids\n\nwith a stranger right and CR there's a\n\nyou're in your primitive mind and so\n\nthere's an intimacy there that that\n\npersists so you go together through a\n\nprocess of fear anxiety like yeah when\n\nthey get you you nod I mean you watch\n\nsomebody like catch somebody if you know\n\nnot so much in professional fighting but\n\nif people are sparring that they catch\n\nyou you

mean I think about who I chose to\n\nwork for as an undergraduate right I was\n\na you know barely finished high school\n\nfinally get to College\n\nbarely I think this is really\n\nembarrassing and

more\n\nin the series on Mental Health coming\n\nout but there are different drives\n\nwithin us there's this\n\nthere are aggressive drives not always\n\nfor fighting but for intense interaction\n\nI mean look at Twitter look at some of\n\nlook at people clearly have an\n\naggressive Drive there's also a pleasure\n\nDrive some people also have a strong\n\npleasure Drive they want to experience\n\npleasure through food through sex\n\nthrough friendship through Adventure you\n\nknow but I think the Shakespearean drama\n\nis the drama of the different drives in\n\ndifferent ratios in different people I I\n\nknow somebody and she's incredibly kind\n\nhas an extremely high pleasure Drive\n\nloves taking great care of herself and\n\npeople around her through food and\n\nthrough Retreats and through all these\n\nthings and makes spaces beautiful\n\neverywhere she goes and is gifts these\n\nthings that are just so unbelievably\n\nfeminine and incredible these gifts to\n\npeople and the kind and thoughtful about\n\nwhat they like and then\n\num but I would say very little\n\naggressive Drive\n\num from my read and then I know other\n\npeople who are just have a ton of\n\naggressive drive and very low pleasure\n\ndrive and I think so there's this\n\nalchemy that exists where people have\n\nthese things in different ratios and\n\nthen you blend in\n\num you know the differences in the\n\nchromosomes and differences in hormones\n\nand differences in personal history and\n\nwhat you end up with is a species\n\nthat\n\ncreates incredible recipes of drama but\n\nalso peace also relief from drama\n\ncontentment I mean I realize this isn't\n\nthe exact topic of the question but\n\num someone I know\n\nvery dearly actually an ex-girlfriend of\n\nmine long-term partner mine\n\num sent me something recently I think it\n\nhit the nail on the head which is that\n\nideally\n\nfor a man they eventually settle where\n\nthey find and feel peace or they feel\n\npeaceful where they can be themselves\n\nand feel peaceful now I'm sure there's a\n\nequivalent or mirror image of that for\n\nwomen but this particular post that she\n\nsent was about men and

hard things and then I\n\nthink at some point I'm certainly coming\n\nto this point now where it's like yeah\n\nthat's all great and checked a lot of\n\nboxes but had a lot of close calls

the career\n\nthey wanted went off a cliff or the the\n\ntheir health went off a cliff or their\n\nlife went off a cliff but I think that\n\num there's also the Shakespearean drama\n\nof the characters that exit the play and\n\nare living their lives happily in the\n\nbackdrop it just doesn't make for as\n\nmuch entertainment\n\nthat's one other thing that's a benefit\n\nyou could say is the benefit of getting\n\nolder is uh\n\num finding the Shakespearean drama less\n\nappealing or finding the joy in the\n\npeace yeah definitely I mean I think\n\nthat\n\num I think there's real peace with age I\n\nthink the other thing is this notion of\n\nchecking boxes is a real thing I for me\n\nanyway I I have a morning meditation\n\nthat I do\n\num well I wake up now I get my sunlight\n\nI

of an inventory\n\nof where I've been where I'm at and\n\nwhere I'm going as they say\n\num and I don't know why I do it but I\n\nstarted doing it this last year I think\n\nbecause\n\num it helps me

and so you might say well\n\nhow is that different than a meditation\n\nwell it I'm acknowledging that there is\n\nsomething that bigger than me bigger\n\nthan nature as I understand it that I\n\ncannot understand or control nor do I\n\nwant to and I'm just giving over to that\n\nand does that make me less of a\n\nscientist I I sure tell hope not I\n\ncertainly know I there's the head of our\n\nneurosciences at Stanford until recently\n\num I you should talk to him directly\n\nabout it Bill Newsom has talked about\n\nhis religious life\n\num for me it's really a way of getting\n\noutside myself and then understanding\n\nhow I fit into this bigger picture and\n\nit's and the Character defects part is\n\nreal right I'm a human I have defects\n\nlike\n\nI got a lot of

traditional\n\nstandardized religion but if we don't\n\nbelieve in something bigger than\n\nourselves we uh at some level will\n\nself-destruct\n\nI really I really think so it's power\n\nand it's powerful in a way that all the\n\nother stuff meditation and all the tools\n\nis is not because it's really operating\n\nat a much deeper and bigger level and um\n\nyou know if\n\nyeah I think I think that's all I can\n\ntalk about it um mostly because I'm\n\nstill working out you know the\n\nscientists in me wants to understand how\n\nit works and I want to understand and\n\nthe point is to just go you know\n\nthere's some there's you know for lack\n\nof a better language for it there's\n\nhigher power than me and what I can\n\ncontrol I'm giving up control on certain\n\nthings and somehow that restores a sense\n\nof agency\n\nfor for right action better action I\n\nthink perhaps a part of that is just the\n\nhumility that comes with acknowledging\n\nthere's something bigger and

me to some fish store and then\n\nspending all my time there until they\n\nthrow me out you know all of that but I\n\nalso remember my entire life I would\n\nsecretly pray\n\nwhen things were good and things weren't\n\ngood but mostly when things weren't good\n\nbecause it's important to pray for me\n\nit's important to pray each morning\n\nregardless but when things\n\nweren't right I couldn't get

that\n\nsits below the surface like an iceberg\n\nand\n\nand I and the fact that when we're kids\n\nwe're not\n\nobscuring a lot of that subconscious as\n\nmuch and and sometimes that can look a\n\nlittle more primitive I mean I mean a\n\nkid that's disappointed will let you\n\nknow a kid that's excited will let you\n\nknow and you feel that raw exuberance or\n\nthat raw dismail and I think

know certainly my experience has\n\ntaught me that a lot of people\n\nbut\n\nI'll talk about men because that's what\n\nI know best\n\nwhether or not they show up strong or\n\nnot\n\nthat they're really afraid of\n\nbeing weak like they're just afraid like\n\nsometimes the strength is even a way to\n\ntry and not be weak right which is\n\ndifferent than being strong for its own\n\nsake I'm not just talking about physical\n\nstrength I'm talking about intellectual\n\nstrength I'm talking about money I'm\n\ntalking about\n\num\n\nexpressing Drive I've been watching this\n\num series a little bit of uh chimp\n\nEmpire oh yeah so chimp Empire is\n\namazing right they have the head champ\n\nhe's not the head chimp but the the the\n\nalpha in the group yeah and he's getting\n\nolder and so what does he do every once\n\nin a while he goes on these Vigor\n\ndisplays he goes and he grabs Branch he\n\nstarts breaking him he starts thrashing\n\nhim and he's incredibly strong and\n\nthey're all kind of like watching I mean\n\nyeah I immediately think of people like\n\nthey're dead lifting on Instagram and I\n\njust think the displays a Vigor this is\n\njust the primate sewing that displays\n\nthe figure now what's interesting is\n\nthat he's doing that specifically to say\n\nhey I still have what it takes to lead\n\nthis troop okay then they're the the\n\nones that are subordinate to him but not\n\nso not so far behind it seems to be that\n\nthere's a very clear like numerical\n\nranking there is like it's it's clear\n\nwho's the number two number three yeah I\n\nmean who gets to mate first who gets to\n\neat first this exists in other animal\n\nsocieties too but uh Bob sapolski would\n\nbe a great person to talk about this\n\nwith because he knows obviously\n\ntremendous amount about it and I I know\n\njust the top Contour but\n\num yeah so number two three and four\n\nmales are\n\naware that he's doing these Vigor\n\ndisplays but they're also aware because\n\nin primary Evolution they got some extra\n\nforebrain too not as much as us but they\n\ngot some and they're aware that the\n\nVigor displays are displays that because\n\nthey've done them as well in a different\n\ncontext might not just be displays of\n\nvigor but might also be an insurance\n\npolicy against people seeing weakness\n\nokay so now they start using that\n\nprefrontal cortex to do some interesting\n\nthings so in in primate world if a male\n\nis friendly with another man wants to\n\naffiliate with him and say hey I'm\n\nbacking you they'll go over and

an\n\nopportunity to talk about because it's\n\nsomething that I'm obsessed with lately\n\nis this notion of overt versus covert\n\ncontracts right there are overt\n\ncontracts where you exchange work for\n\nmoney or you exchange any number of\n\nthings in an overt way but then there\n\nare covert contracts um and those take\n\non a very different form and always lead\n\nto uh in my belief bad things well how\n\nmuch of human and chimp relationships\n\nare over versus covert well here's one\n\nthing that we know is true\n\ndogs and humans the dog to human\n\nrelationship is 100 overt they don't\n\nmanipulate you now you could say they do\n\nin the sense that they learn that if\n\nthey look a certain way or roll on their\n\nback they get food but there's no\n\num there's no banking of that behavior\n\nfor a future date where then they are\n\ngoing to undermine you and take your\n\nposition okay so in that sense dogs can\n\nbe a little bit manipulative in some\n\nsense but\n\num now okay so overt contract\n\nwould be\n\nwe both want to do some work together\n\nwe're going to make some money you get X\n\npercentage I get X percentage it's overt\n\ncovert contract\n\nwhich is in my opinion bad always bad\n\nwould be we're gonna do some work\n\ntogether you're gonna get a percentage\n\nof money I'm gonna get a percentage of\n\nmoney\n\ncould look just like the overt contract\n\nbut secretly I'm resentful that I got\n\nthe percentage I got\n\nso what I start doing is covertly taking\n\nsomething else what do I take maybe I\n\ntake the opportunity to jab you verbally\n\nevery once in a while maybe I take the\n\nopportunity to show up late maybe I take\n\nthe opportunity to get to know one of\n\nyour co-workers so that I might start a\n\nbusiness with them that's covert\n\nContracting and you see this sometimes\n\nin romantic relationships one person we\n\nwon't set the male or female in any\n\ndirection here and just say\n\nit's I'll make you feel powerful if you\n\nmake me feel desired okay great there's\n\nnothing explicitly wrong about that\n\ncontract if they both know and they both\n\nagree but what if it's I'll do that but\n\nI'll have kids with you so you feel\n\npowerful you'll have kids with me so I\n\nfeel desired but secretly I don't want\n\nto do that\n\nor they one person says I don't want to\n\ndo that or both don't so what they end\n\nup doing is saying okay so I expect\n\nsomething else I expect you to do\n\ncertain things for me or I expect you to\n\npay for certain things for me covert\n\ncontracts are the signature of\n\neverything bad overt contracts are the\n\nsignature of all things good yeah and I\n\nthink about this a lot because I've seen\n\na lot of examples of this I've\n\nlike anyone we participate in

in the exchange\n\nand I'll tell you\n\nif there's one thing about human nature\n\nthat's bad it's that\n\nfeature why that feature or is it a bug\n\nor a feature as you Engineers like to\n\nsay\n\num I think it's because we were\n\nallocated a certain extra amount of\n\nprefrontal Cortex that makes us more\n\nsophisticated than a dog\n\nmore sophisticated than a chimpanzee but\n\nthey do it too and\n\nit's because it's often harder\n\nto deal with in the short term to deal\n\nwith the real sense of this is scary\n\nthis feels threatening than it is to\n\nplay out all the iterations it takes a\n\nlot of brain work you're playing chess\n\nand go simultaneously trying to figure\n\nout where things are going to end up and\n\nwe just don't know so it's a way I think\n\nof creating a false sense of certainty\n\nbut I'll tell you covert contracts the\n\nonly certainty is that it's going to end\n\nbadly the question is how badly\n\nconversely overt contracts always end\n\nwell\n\nalways the problem with overt contracts\n\nis that you can't be certain that the\n\nother person is not engaging in a covert\n\ncontract you can only take\n\nresponsibility for your own Contracting\n\nwell one of the challenges of being\n\nhuman is looking at another human being\n\nand figuring out\n\nthe way their way of being their\n\nbehavior which of the two types of\n\ncontracts it represents because they\n\nlook awfully the same on the surface and\n\nit's one of the one of the challenges of\n\nbeing human is the decision we all make\n\nis are you somebody that takes a leap of\n\ntrust and trusts other humans that are\n\nwilling to take the hurt are you going\n\nto be cynical and skeptical and avoid\n\nmost interactions until they're uh they\n\nover a long period of time prove your\n\ntrust yeah I never liked the phrase\n\nhistory repeats itself\n\num when it comes to humans because it\n\ndoesn't apply if the people or the\n\nperson is actively working to resolve\n\ntheir own flaws I do think that if\n\npeople are willing to do dedicated\n\nintrospective work go into their\n\nsubconscious\n\ndo the hard work have hard conversations\n\nand get better at hard conversations\n\nsomething that I'm constantly trying to\n\nget better at I think people can change\n\nbut they have to want to change it does\n\nseem like\n\ndeep down we all can kind of tell the\n\ndifference between over and covert like\n\nwe have a good sense I think one of the\n\nbenefits of having this characteristical\n\nmind where I value loyalty I've been\n\nextremely uh fortunate to spend most of\n\nmy life in overt relationships and I\n\nthink that creates a really fulfilling\n\nlife but there's also this thing that\n\nmaybe we're in this uh portion of the\n\npodcast now but\n\num this is late at night we're talking\n\nthat's right certainly late for me but\n\nI'm two hours I came in today on uh I'm\n\nstill in California we should also say\n\nthat you came here to wish me a happy\n\nbirthday I did I did I and the podcast\n\nis just like a a fun last minute thing I\n\nsuggested yeah some um close friends of\n\nyours have arranged a dinner that I'm\n\nreally

continue to\n\nget better the key is to not get injured\n\nand I I've never trained super hard I've\n\ntrained hard but I've been cautious to\n\nnot for instance weight train more than\n\ntwo days in a row I do a split which\n\nbasically three days a week and the\n\nother day is a run take one full day off\n\ntake a week off every 12 to 16 weeks\n\nI've not been the guy hurling the\n\nheaviest

get\n\nhurt but it's not like skateboarding\n\nwhere if you if you're going for you're\n\ngonna get hurt that's just you're\n\nlanding on concrete and\n\num it with Jiu Jitsu like people are\n\ntrying to hurt you so that you say stop\n\num so with a sport it's different\n\num and these days I don't really do a\n\nsport any longer\n\num I work out\n\num to stay fit I I used to\n\num continue to do

you\n\nwant to say well I'll do a heel flip\n\ninstead but okay\n\num uh I might put out a little part\n\nbecause some of the guys that work on\n\nour podcast are from DC I think by now I\n\nI I should at least do it just to show\n\nlike I'm not making it up\n\num and I probably will but I think that\n\ndoing a sport is different that's how\n\nyou get hurt\n\noveruse and doing it an actual sport and\n\nso you know hat tip to those do an\n\nactual sport\n\nand that's a difficult decision like I a\n\nlot of people have to make I have to\n\nmake with Jiu Jitsu for example like if\n\nyou just look empirically I've trained\n\nreally hard from all my life and\n\ngrappling Sports and fighting Sports and\n\nall this kind of stuff and I've avoided\n\ninjury for the most part and I would say\n\nI would attribute that to\n\num training a lot sounds\n\ncounterintuitive but training well and\n\nsafely and correctly keeping good form\n\nsaying no and I need to say no but\n\ntraining a lot and taking it seriously\n\nnow when this training is kind of a side\n\nreally a side thing I find that the\n\ninjury is uh becomes a higher and higher\n\nprobability when you're just doing it\n\nevery once in a while every once in a\n\nwhile yeah that I think you said\n\nsomething really important that the um\n\nsaying no I mean the times I have gotten\n\nhurt training is when someone's like hey\n\nlet's hop on this workout together and\n\nit becomes uh let's challenge each other\n\nto do something outrageous\n\num sometimes that can be fun though I\n\nwent up to cam haines's gym and he

okay\n\nthis has to do with eye spots\n\nthis was during a government shutdown\n\nperiod where the ghost shrimp that they\n\nnormally\n\num feed on that we would ship in from\n\nthe Gulf down here

that you want no matter\n\nhow outrageous and communicate that\n\nimmediately and that will work we're\n\ntalking about coefficient sexual\n\nselection and then we went into some uh\n\nwhere do we go well and you said you\n\nwere excited I was I was I was excited\n\nwell you were just saying what about\n\nthese these covert contracts and animals\n\ndo them I think it's simple contextual\n\nengagement of a neural circuit which is\n\nnot just nerd speak for saying they do a\n\ndifferent strategy saying that there has\n\nto be a circuit there hardwired circuit\n\nmaybe learned but probably hardwired\n\nthat can be engaged right you can't\n\nbuild neural Machinery out of in a\n\nmoment\n\num you need to build that circuit over\n\ntime what is building it over time

the ice\n\nspotted shrimp showed up and there were\n\na couple that had some miswiring this is\n\nwhy mutation right X-Men type stuff is\n\nreal\n\num they had a mutation they had some\n\nalternate wiring and that wiring got\n\nselected before it became a mutation\n\nthat was adaptive as opposed to male\n\nadaptive this is something people don't\n\noften understand about genetics is that\n\nit only takes a few generations to\n\ndevolve a trait make it worse but it\n\ntakes a long time to evolve an Adaptive\n\ntrait there are exceptions to that but\n\nmost often that's true so a species\n\nneeds a lot of generations we are\n\nhopefully still evolving as a species\n\nand it takes a long time but uh to\n\nevolve more adaptive traits but doesn't\n\ntake long to to

take\n\ndifferent forms\n\num I mean I certainly experience being a\n\nfamily in a prior relationship where it\n\nwas the two of us and our two dogs and\n\nit was like it was family like we had\n\nour little family\n\num\n\nI think\n\nbased on my experience and based on\n\ninput from friends who themselves have\n\nvery successful relationships I must say\n\nI've got friends who\n\num are in long-term monogamous\n\nvery happy\n\nuh relationships where there seems to be\n\num a lot of love a lot of laughter\n\na loud Challenge and a lot of growth\n\nand both people\n\nit seems really want to be there and\n\nenjoy being there\n\nit's just a pause on that one thing\n\nto do I think by way of advice is listen\n\nto people who are in long-term\n\nsuccessful relationships that's like uh\n\nit seems dumb but like like we both know\n\nand are friends with Joe Rogan who's\n\nbeen in a long-term really great\n\nrelationship and he's been an\n\ninspiration to me so you take advice\n\nfrom that guy definitely and several\n\nmembers of my podcast team are in\n\nexcellent relationships I I think\n\num one of the things that Rings true\n\nover and over again in the advice and in\n\nmy experience is\n\nyou know find someone who's really a\n\ngreat friend like build a really great\n\nfriendship with that person now\n\nobviously not just a friend if we're\n\ntalking romantic relationship but\n\num and of course sex is super important\n\nbut it should be a part of\n\nthat particular relationship alongside\n\nor meshed with the Friendship uh\n\ncan it be a majority of the the positive\n\nexchange I suppose it could but I think\n\nthe Friendship piece is extremely\n\nimportant because what's required in a\n\nsuccessful relationship clearly is\n\njoy in being together\n\nTrust\n\na desire to share experience both you\n\nknow mundane and and More Adventurous\n\nsupport each other\n\nacceptance\n\na real\n\nmaybe even admiration but certainly\n\nDelight in

romantic relationship or ideally both\n\nbecause let's assume healthy relation\n\nthe best romantic relationship includes\n\na friendship component with that person\n\nit's like you just freely

they\n\nbetray\n\nthey're afraid of giving up too much\n\nvulnerability so they hide their\n\nvulnerability or in the worst cases they\n\nfeign vulnerability\n\num again that's a covert contract

work really hard\n\non in recent years that I'm still\n\nworking hard on but the Friendship piece\n\nseems to be the thing that rises to the\n\ntop when I talk to friends who are in\n\nthese great relationships it's like they\n\nthey have so much respect and love and\n\njoy in being with their friend is the\n\nperson that they want to spend as much\n\nof their non-working non\n\nuh platonic

enter through that portal which\n\nmakes sense that's that's the mating\n\ndance right that's the peacock situation\n\nthat's hopefully not the Cuttlefish\n\nsituation\n\num but but I think that\n\num there seems to be\n\na history of people close to me getting\n\ninto great relationships where they were\n\nfriends for a while first or maybe\n\ndidn't sleep together right away yeah\n\nthat they actually intentionally\n\ndeferred on that\n\num this has not been\n\nmy habit or my experience you know I've\n\ngone to more\n\num I think typical like oh there's an\n\nattraction like this person there's an\n\ninterest you kind of explore all\n\ndimensions of relationship really\n\nquickly except perhaps the moving in\n\npart and having kids part\n\num which ideally because it's a bigger\n\nstep harder to undo without more severe\n\nconsequences\n\nbut I think\n\nthe whole take it slow thing\n\num I don't think is about getting to\n\nknow someone slowly I think it's about\n\nthat physical piece because that does\n\nchange the nature of the relationship\n\nand I think it's because it gets right\n\ninto the more hardwired primitive\n\ncircuitry around our feelings of of\n\nsafety vulnerability\n\num you know there's something about\n\nuh romantic and sexual interactions\n\nwhere it's almost like\n\nit's like assets and liabilities right\n\nwhere people are trying to figure out\n\nhow much to engage their time and their\n\nenergy and multiple people I'm talking\n\nabout from both sides you know male\n\nfemale or whatever it decides but where\n\nit's like assets and liabilities and and\n\nthat that's where it starts getting I um\n\ninto those\n\ncomplicated contracts early on I think\n\nand so maybe that's why if a really\n\ngreat friendship and admiration is is\n\nestablished first\n\neven if people are romantically and\n\nsexually attracted to one another then\n\nthat piece can be added in a little bit\n\nlater in a way that\n\nreally kind

something\n\nthere about\n\nstaying out of a certain amount of um\n\nuh risk of having to engage covert\n\ncontract in order to protect oneself\n\nbut I I do think like\n\nuh\n\nlove at first sight this kind of idea is\n\nuh in part realizing very quickly that\n\nyou are great friends like I've had that\n\ninteresting experience a friendship\n\nrecently just it's not really friendship\n\nbut

it started out as a great\n\nuh sexual connection oh well there you\n\ngo but then became very close friends\n\nafter that listen there you go uh So\n\nspeaking of sex\n\nhe was uh he has a wonderful son and\n\nhe's wanting to have a second kid and he\n\nwanted to ask the great Andrew huberman\n\nis there uh like sexual positions or any\n\nkind of thing that can help\n\nmaximize the chance that they have a\n\ngirl versus a boy because they're that\n\nwonderful boy they want a girl is there\n\nis there a way to control the gender\n\nthis has been debated for a long time\n\nand I did a uh four and a half hour\n\nepisode on fertility and the reason I\n\ndid a four and a half hour episode of\n\nfertility is that first of all I find\n\nthat the reproductive biology be\n\nfascinating and I wanted a resource for\n\npeople that\n\num were thinking about or struggling\n\nwith having kids uh for whatever reason\n\num and it felt important to me to\n\ncombine the male and female components\n\nin the same episode it's all time\n\nstamped so you don't have to listen to\n\nthe whole thing I'm gonna talk about IVF\n\nand virtual fertilization we talk about\n\nnatural pregnancy okay the data on\n\nposition is very interesting but let me\n\njust say a few things there are a few\n\nclinics now in particular some out of\n\nthe United States that are spinning down\n\nsperm and finding that they can separate\n\nout fractions as they're called you know\n\nthat can spin the sperm down at a given\n\nspeed and they'll separate out at\n\ndifferent\n\num sort of depths within the test tube\n\nthat allow them to pull out the sperm on\n\ntop or below and bias the probability\n\ntowards male or female births it's not\n\nperfect it's not 100 it's a very costly\n\nprocedure it's still very controversial\n\num now with in vitro fertilization it\n\ncan extract eggs you can do introduce a\n\nsperm directly by pipette it's a process\n\ncalled ixy or you can set up a sperm\n\nrace in a dish and if you get a number\n\nof different embryos\n\num meaning the eggs get fertilized to\n\nduplicate and for start to form a\n\nblastocyst which is a ball of cells\n\nearly embryo then you can do karyotyping\n\nso you can do look for XX or XY select\n\nthe XY which then would give rise to a\n\nmale offspring and then plant that one\n\nso there is that kind of sex selection\n\num\n\nwith respect to position there's a lot\n\nof lore that you know if\n\num the woman is on top or the woman's on\n\nthe bottom or whether or not the\n\npenetration is from behind whether or\n\nnot it's going to be male or female\n\nOffspring and frankly the data are not\n\ngreat as you can imagine because those\n\nthose would be interesting studies to\n\nrun perhaps\n\num there is studies there is paper there\n\nare some there are they're not I guess\n\nyeah there's more lore than science and\n\nthere's a lot of and there are a lot of\n\nother variables that are hard to control\n\nso for instance if it if it's um\n\nejaculation during intermission during\n\nduring sex penetration Etc\n\num\n\nthen you can't measure for instance\n\nsperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF\n\nand they can actually measure how many\n\nmilliliters how many forward motile\n\nsperm it's hard to control for for\n\ncertain things and um this can vary\n\nbetween individuals and even from one\n\nejaculation the next

15 degrees upwards\n\nI mean you know\n\nsome of the fertility experts MDS will\n\nsay that's crazy you know but others\n\nthat I\n\nsought out and not specifically for this\n\nanswer but for researching that episode\n\nsaid that yeah you know what you're\n\ntalking about is trying to get the\n\nmaximum number of sperm and it's\n\ncontained in semen and yes the semen can\n\nleak out and so keeping um the pelvis\n\ntilted for about at 15 degrees for about\n\n15 minutes obviously tilted in the\n\ndirection that would have things running\n\nUpstream not Downstream so to speak\n\nwould gravity it's real\n\num you know\n\num so so for maximizing uh fertilization\n\nyou know that the doctors I spoke to\n\njust said look given that if people are\n\ntrying to get pregnant what is spending\n\n15 minutes on their back\n\num you know this sort of thing okay so\n\nthen with respect to there to female\n\ngetting a female Offspring or XX\n\nfemale Offspring\n\num\n\nselectively there is the idea that as\n\nfathers get older they're more likely to\n\nhave daughters as opposed to Sons that's\n\na from the papers I've read is a\n\nsignificant but still mildly significant\n\nresult so at with each passing year\n\num this person increases the probability\n\nthey're gonna have a daughter not a son\n\nlook um so that's interesting but the\n\nprobability differences are probably\n\ntiniest I mean it's it's not you know\n\nit's a signif it's not trivial it's not\n\na trivial difference\n\num but if they want to ensure having\n\na daughter then they should do IVF and\n\nselect an xxm um embryo and um when you\n\ngo through IVF they genetically screen\n\nthem for karyotype which is xxxy\n\num and they look at mutations genotypic\n\nmutations for things like you know\n\ntrisomies and the employees all the\n\nstuff you don't want\n\nbut there is a lot of lore if you look\n\non the internet sure different foods uh\n\nso a lot of variables there's a lot of\n\narea but there haven't been systematic\n\nstudies so\n\num I think probably the best thing to do\n\nunless they're going to do IVF is just\n\nyou know roll the dice and um you know\n\nand I think uh with each passing year\n\nthey increase the probability of getting\n\na female Offspring\n\num and with but of course with each\n\npassing year the egg and sperm quality\n\ndegrade so you know get after it soon so\n\nuh I went down a rabbit hole there's\n\nlike sexology there's there's journals\n\noh yeah on sex sure okay so I and some\n\nof them some of them

it\n\nlike she does like very kind of Internet\n\ntype content\n\num but she's a legitimate urologist\n\nreproductive health expert and in the\n\npodcast we we did talk about\n\num both male and female orgasm we talked\n\na lot about sexual function dysfunction\n\nwe talked a lot about pelvic floor one\n\ninteresting factoid is that\n\nonly three only three percent of sexual\n\ndysfunction is\n\nforeign\n\nin nature it's more often related to\n\nsome pelvic floor or vasculature blood\n\nflow related or other issue and then\n\nwhen Eisenberg came on the podcast he\n\nsaid that far less

sexual dysfunction is\n\npsychogenic in origin then people\n\nbelieve that far more of it is pelvic\n\nfloor neuro and Vascular so you know\n\nthere's there are the myths of\n\num I mean it's not saying that it's that\n\npsychogenic dysfunction doesn't exist\n\nbut that a lot of the sexual dysfunction\n\nthat people assume is related to\n\nhormones or that is related to\n\npsychogenic issues are related to\n\nvascular or neural issues and the good\n\nnews is that there are great remedies\n\nfor those and um and so those both those\n\nepisodes detail some of the\n\num more Salient points about what those\n\nremedies are and could be I mean one of\n\nthe kind of again\n\nfactoids but it's interesting that you\n\nknow a lot of people have pelvic floor\n\nissues and they think that their pelvic\n\nfloors are\n\num quote unquote messed up so they go on\n\nthe internet they learn about kegels\n\nkegels that you know and it turns out\n\nthat some people need Giggles they need\n\nto strengthen their pelvic floor guess\n\nwhat\n\na huge number of people with sexual and\n\nneurologic\n\ndysfunction\n\nhave pelvic floors that are too tight\n\nand kegels are going to make them far\n\nworse and they actually need to learn to\n\nrelax their pelvic floor instead of\n\nseeing a pelvic floor specialist is\n\nimportant I think in the next five ten\n\nyears we're going to see a dramatic\n\nshift towards more discussion about\n\nsexual and reproductive Health in a way\n\nthat acknowledges that yeah the clitoris\n\nis comes from the same origin tissue as\n\nthe the penis and in many ways that the\n\nneural innervation of the two while\n\nclearly different has some overlapping\n\nfeatures that\n\num you know that there's going to be\n\ndiscussion around kind of anatomy and\n\nhormones and pelvic floors and\n\num in a way that's gonna you know um\n\nerode some of the the kind of like\n\ncloaking of these topics because they've\n\nbeen cloaked for a long time and there's\n\na lot of like\n\nbut let's just call what it is there's a\n\nlot of out there about what's\n\nwhat\n\num and now the hormonal issues by the\n\nway just to clarify can impact desire so\n\na lot of people who have lack of desire\n\nas opposed to lack of anatomical\n\nfunction this could be male or female\n\nthat that can originate with either\n\nthings like ssris or hormonal issues and\n\nso we talk about that as well so it's a\n\npretty vast topic okay you've uh you're\n\none of the most productive people I know\n\nuh what what's the secret to your\n\nproductivity how do you uh maximize the\n\nnumber of productive hours in a day your\n\nscientist your teacher you're a very\n\nprolific educator\n\nwell thanks for the kind words I\n\nstruggle like everybody else but I\n\num

with the podcast you uh\n\nthere's certain episodes\n\nI mean you're like taking just\n\nincredibly difficult topics and you know\n\nthey're going to be there's going to be\n\na lot of really good scientists\n\nlistening to those with a very skeptical\n\nand careful eye\n\nlike how hard do you struggle meeting\n\nthat deadline sometimes yeah so we've\n\npushed out episodes because I want more\n\ntime with them I also I haven't\n\nadvertised this um but I have another\n\nuh fully tenured professor that's\n\nstarted um checking my my\n\num podcasts and helping me\n\num find papers he's

how much total\n\nfocus can you give to something and then\n\nI like to take walks and think about\n\nthings\n\num and sometimes talk about them in my\n\nvoice recorder so I'm just always\n\nchurning

it\n\nburst and then as we've gotten into\n\ntopics that are a little bit further\n\naway from my my um home knowledge you\n\nknow it the it's like\n\nI still get super excited about it it's\n\nmusic in the Brain Episode I've been\n\nresearching for a while and I'm just so\n\nhyped like about it it's so so\n\ninteresting there's so many facets\n\nsinging versus improvation\n\nimprovisational excuse me music versus\n\nI'm listening to music versus\n\num learning music I mean it just goes on\n\nand on there's just so much that's so\n\ninteresting I just can't get enough and\n\nand I think\n\noh you put a camera in front of me I\n\nsort of forget about it uh and I'm just\n\ntrying to just teach yes that's the\n\ndifference that's interesting I mean I\n\nforget the camera maybe I need to find\n\nthat joy as well but like for me a lot\n\nof the joys in the in the writing and uh\n\nthe the camera there's something well\n\nthe best lecturers as you know and\n\nyou're in a phenomenal lecturer so you\n\nembody this as well but the when I teach\n\nat Stanford I was directing this course\n\nin neuroanatomy and Neuroscience and for\n\nmedical students and I noticed that the\n\nbest lecturers would come in and they're\n\nteaching the material from a place of\n\ndeep understanding but they're also\n\nexperiencing it as a first-time learner\n\nas at the same time so it's just sort of\n\nembodying the Delight of it but also the\n\nauthority over them not Authority but\n\nthe the sort of Mastery of the material\n\nand it's really the Delight in it that\n\nthe students are linking on to and of\n\ncourse they need and deserve the best\n\naccurate material so they have to know\n\nwhat they're talking about but\n\num yeah just tap into that energy of\n\nlearning and loving it and people were\n\nalong for the ride or you know I get\n\naccused of being long-winded but you\n\nknow things get taken out of context\n\nthat leads to Greater misunderstanding\n\nand also I look at listen I come from a\n\nlineage of three debt advisors three all\n\nthree\n\nso I don't know when the reaper is\n\ncoming for me I'm doing my best to stay\n\nalive a long time but whether or not\n\nit's a bullet or a bus or\n\ncancer or whatever or just old age I\n\nmean I'm trying to get it all out there\n\nas best I can and if it means you have\n\nto hit pause and come back a day or two\n\nlater like that seems like a reasonable\n\ncompromise to me I'm not gonna go\n\num go longer than I need to and I'm\n\ntrying to shorten them up but uh again\n\nthat's just kind of how I show up it's\n\nlike Tim Armstrong would say about\n\nwriting songs I asked him do you write\n\nhow often you write every day\n\nevery day was Rick ever stop creating no\n\nis Joe ever stop preparing for comedy\n\nare you ever stopping to think about\n\nworld issues and and technology and who\n\nyou can talk to I mean it seems to me\n\nyou've always got a plan\n\nthe inside the the thing I love about\n\nyour podcast the most\n\nto be honest these days is the surprise\n\nof like I don't know who the hell is\n\ngoing to be there it's almost like like\n\nI get a little nervously excited about\n\nwhen a new episode comes out because I\n\nhave no idea no idea and you know I mean\n\nI have some guesses based on what you\n\ntold me during the break I mean yeah\n\nyou've got someone people where it's\n\njust like whoa Lexus went there awesome\n\ncan't wait click you know there you know\n\nI think that's really cool like you're\n\nconstantly surprising people so you're\n\ndoing it so well like it's such a high\n\nlevel and I think it's also important\n\nfor people to understand that what\n\nyou're doing relax\n\nthere's no precedent for

to do the content like yours\n\nzero there's one peer you\n\nand so you know that should give you\n\ngreat peace and great excitement because\n\nyou're you're a Pioneer you're the\n\nyou're literally the tip of the spear I\n\nI don't want to take an unnecessary\n\ntangent but I think this might thread\n\ntogether two of the things that we've\n\nbeen talking about which are I think of\n\npretty key importance one is romantic\n\nrelationships and the other is creative\n\nprocess and work and this again is\n\nsomething I learned from Rick but that\n\nhe and I have gone back and forth on and\n\nthat\n\num I think is worth elaborating on which\n\nis\n\nearlier we're saying you know the best\n\nrelationship is going to be one where\n\nyou where it brings you peace I think\n\npeace also can be translated to among\n\nother things\n\nlack of distraction so when you're with\n\nyour partner can you really focus on\n\nthem and the relationship\n\ncan you not be distracted by\n\nthings that you're upset about from\n\ntheir past or from your past with them\n\nor their and of course the same is true\n\nfor them right they ideally will feel\n\nthat way towards you too they can really\n\nfocus also\n\nwhen you're not with them can you focus\n\non your work can you not be worried\n\nabout whether or not they're okay\n\nbecause you trust that they're an adult\n\nand they can handle things or they will\n\nreach out if they need things\n\num they're going to communicate their\n\nneeds like an adult you know not\n\ncreating message just to get attention\n\nand things like that or\n\nor disappearing you know for that matter\n\nso\n\npeace and focus are intimately related\n\nand distraction is the enemy of peace\n\nand focus\n\nso there's something there I believe\n\num because with people that have a\n\nstrong generative drive and want to you\n\nknow be productive in their home life in\n\nthe sense have a rich family life\n\num or partner life whatever that is and\n\nin their work life\n\nyou know the ability to really drop into\n\nthe work and\n\nlike okay you might have that sense like\n\nI hope they're okay or you know need to\n\ncheck my phone or something but just\n\nknow like we're good yeah so so peace\n\nand focus I think and present being\n\npresent are so key and it's key at every\n\nlevel of romantic relationship from\n\num you know certainly presence and focus\n\nyou know everything from sex to\n\nlistening to\n\num to you know raising a family to\n\ntending to the house\n\num and in work it's absolutely critical\n\nso I think that those things are kind of\n\nmirror images of the same thing and\n\nthey're both important reflections of\n\nthe other and when you start to just you\n\nknow when work is not going well then\n\nthe relationship the focus on\n\nrelationship can suffer and vice versa\n\nso and it's crazy how important that is\n\noh\n\nhow incredibly\n\num uh wonderful it could be to have a\n\nperson in your life that kind of uh\n\nenables that creative Focus yeah and you\n\nsupply the the peace and focus for their\n\nEndeavors whatever those might be I mean\n\nthat that symmetry there\n\num because clearly people have different\n\nneeds and the need to just really trust\n\nyou know like when Lex is working he's\n\nin his generative mode and and and I\n\nknow he's good and so then they they\n\nfeel sure they've contributed to that\n\nbut then also what you're doing is\n\nsupporting them in whatever way it\n\nhappens to be and I think that sometimes\n\nyou'll see that people will pair up\n\nalong creative creative or Musical\n\nmusical or\n\num computer scientists but I think again\n\ngoing back to this Conti episode on on\n\nrelationships is that the superficial\n\nlabels are less important it seems than\n\njust the desire to create that kind of\n\nhome life in a relationship together and\n\nas a consequence the the work mode and\n\nfor some people there both people aren't\n\nworking and sometimes they are but I\n\nthink that's I think that's the good\n\nstuff you know and and I think that's\n\nthe big learning in all of it is that\n\nthe further along I go with

right there they're the like the\n\nthey're like the tribal Elders right and\n\num and we're you know we're not the the\n\nyoungest in the crew but we're we're if\n\nyou look at all those guys\n\nthey all have kids\n\nthey all adore their kids and their kids\n\nbring tremendous meaning to their life\n\nlike we we'd be morons if\n\nyou know if you didn't go off and start\n\na family I didn't start
